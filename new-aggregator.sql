The strike has meant that actors have been unable to engage with the regular interview circuit, meaning that a major component of a film’s awareness campaign has been decimated. Last week, the Hollywood Reporter <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/box-office-ninja-turtles-star-campaigns-1235568835/\">estimated</a> that the box office for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem has been hit by up to 15% with stars such as Seth Rogen, Jackie Chan, Maya Rudolph and Ice Cube unable to appear at the premiere, speak to journalists or appear on late-night shows (which are all still on hiatus without writers able to work). This weekend also saw Universal’s foul-mouthed dog comedy Strays sputter out, tracking to make up to $20m for the weekend but <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2023/08/box-office-blue-beetle-strays-barbie-1235522235/\">crashing with just $8m</a>, with stars Will Ferrell and Jamie Foxx muzzled (the latter unable to utilise his 16.8 million Instagram followers). DC’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/aug/16/dc-latino-superhero-film-blue-beetle-review\">Blue Beetle</a> also saw the company’s worst ever opening over the weekend and while the film was short on A-listers, it’s likely that a promotional bump would have helped raise its profile.</p> <p>Network schedules for the upcoming season have also seen a substantial overhaul, with hit shows such as Grey’s Anatomy and NCIS delayed indefinitely and instead, game shows such as the David Spade-hosted Snake Oil and reality shows such as Bachelor in Paradise and Kitchen Nightmares taking the primetime slots. Some networks have also chosen to pay for imports instead, like the UK version of Ghosts, or moved cable or streaming dramas over, like Ms Marvel and Yellowstone. With this summer seeing linear TV viewing dropping to <a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/linear-tv-viewing-share-low-streaming-record-high-nielsen-1235696629/\">a new low</a>, it’s a disastrous prospect for networks, unable to build on recent successes such as Abbott Elementary and Fire Country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58987ccdbb3ca781497aee0a8fb93593022d43b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58987ccdbb3ca781497aee0a8fb93593022d43b5/0_44_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carey Mulligan and Bradley Cooper in Maestro\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carey Mulligan and Bradley Cooper in Maestro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason McDonald/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The end of the summer is also the start of the all-important fall festival season, where starry films get unveiled around the world aiming for critical adoration leading to awards recognition. It all begins with the Venice film festival on 30 August, the starting point for major contenders in the past such as Gravity, A Star is Born, Dune and Birdman. The quality of this year’s lineup was briefly in question (Luca Guadagnino’s tennis romance Challengers was set to open but was pulled once the actors’ strike began) but does now, to the relief of many, look to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/25/venice-film-festival-picks-starry-films-despite-actors-strike\">as robust as ever</a> with new films from David Fincher, Michael Mann, Yorgos Lanthimos, Sofia Coppola and Bradley Cooper. Yet whatever attention the festival usually receives will probably be muted, with stars such as Michael Fassbender, Emma Stone and Carey Mulligan unable to attend, glitzy premiere pictures in short supply. Given that the directors’ guild remains strike-free, column inches might be taken up by the appearance of Roman Polanski and Woody Allen, whose latest films are controversial inclusions.</p> <p>Given that it was made by an independent company rather than a studio, Mann’s motoring drama Ferrari <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2023/08/ferrari-sag-aftra-waiver-adam-driver-penelope-cruz-1235459750/\">has received a waiver</a> from Sag-Aftra that would allow stars Adam Driver and Penélope Cruz to appear at both Venice and the New York film festival, where it’s nabbed the closing night slot, but questions remain over whether the actors will be too, understandably, concerned about optics to attend. Various productions outside of the studio and streamer system have also been granted waivers allowing them to proceed, such as David Lowery’s pop star drama Mother Mary starring Anne Hathaway, but some stars have still chosen not to participate. Viola Davis’s action thriller G20 was given permission to continue production but the actor still <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2023/07/viola-davis-waiver-g20-actors-strike-1235450850/\">decided against</a>, saying in a statement that she didn’t feel it “would be appropriate” to carry on.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/29/los-angeles-actors-writers-strike-businesses-affected\">Dry cleaners, restaurants, hotels: the ripple effects of Hollywood’s strike</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Concurrently with Venice, the Telluride film festival will take place, its lineup still a secret, followed by Toronto, the biggest in size of them all. While this year’s set of films includes Emily Blunt, Kate Winslet, Scarlett Johansson and Olivia Colman, it’s unlikely many big names will appear, despite some films technically allowing for it (this year has more sales titles without studio attachment).</p> <p>While the Warner Bros Discovery CEO, David Zaslav, has <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/warner-bros-discovery-streaming-profit-subscribers-cost-savings-debt-1235548582/\">claimed</a> in the short term the strike has actually saved the company $100m in second-quarter operating costs, the WGA has <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2023/05/wga-strike-costing-studios-30-million-a-day-guild-says-1235367477/\">calculated</a> that the strike is costing California’s economy an estimated $30m a day (the last writers’ strike in 2007-2008 reportedly cost over $2bn for the state and CNBC <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/09/hollywood-strikes-have-had-3-billion-impact-on-california-economy-so-far.html#:~:text=Work-,Hollywood%20strikes%20have%20already%20had%20a%20%243%20billion%20impact%20on,causing%20\'a%20lot%20of%20hardship\'&amp;text=People%20take%20selfies%20beneath%20the,2023%20in%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California.\">reports</a> that if the strikes go on until October, the number could go past $5bn). The demands set forth by the guild, which include improved streaming residuals and a more concrete form of protection against artificial intelligence, are <a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/biz/news/wga-strike-cost-memo-amptp-1235614992/\">estimated</a> to cost the industry a relatively modest $429m a year, considerably less than the culmination of shuttered sets (Variety <a href=\"https://variety.com/2023/film/features/hollywood-chaos-strikes-movie-delays-pay-battles-a-i-anxiety-1235673080/\">reports</a> that soundstages, used on major productions like Gladiator 2, cost up to $600,000 a week to retain), reduced box office and the impact to advertising revenue (in July, brand spending on new viewing content <a href=\"https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/hollywood-strikes-could-cause-advertisers-divert-video-spending\">fell by 21%</a>, the lowest since the pandemic).</p> <p>Back in July, three days before the actors’ strike was official, <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2023/07/writers-strike-hollywood-studios-deal-fight-wga-actors-1235434335/\">Deadline</a> quoted an unnamed studio source who said that the plan was for writers to “start losing their apartments and losing their houses”, a statement that led to widespread anger within the industry and one that was used earlier this month by the actor Billy Porter who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/aug/09/billy-porter-house-actors-strike\">claims</a> to have lost his house over a lack of income caused by the strike. “The life of an artist, until you make fuck-you money – which I haven’t made yet – is still check-to-check,” he said, adding: “… to the person who said, ‘We’re going to starve them out until they have to sell their apartments’ – you’ve already starved me out.” This week, the <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-news/the-strikes-toll-on-mental-health-1235566619/\">Hollywood Reporter</a> also reported on a rise in mental health concerns among those on strike.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb140ff7de40e4b2cf19daccaf54aab83b838f02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb140ff7de40e4b2cf19daccaf54aab83b838f02/0_79_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya in Dune Part 2\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya in Dune Part 2.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niko Tavernise</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So what’s next? If the studios still refuse to make necessary compromises, the industry could be facing a particularly cold end to the year. Rumours have already circulated suggesting that star-led films such as Dune 2 and Aquaman 2 (big-budget sequels which rely on the celebrity of stars such as Timothée Chalamet, Jason Momoa and Zendaya) could be next to move off their release dates, following up the success of Barbenheimer with a tentpole-lacking few months. An actor-free awards season will also mean the gutting of an entire industry of its own with no roundtables, events or campaigning of any sort, something that purists might welcome, but financial sway will still win out regardless, with visibility being awarded to whichever studio has the most money to spend on the most adverts.

I think I am quite soul-baring. I probably overshare. There’s a lot of front-facing people who like to pretend to be strong all the time. I haven’t met anyone who is really like that.”</p> <p>But she was strong at those world championships in Budapest. Particularly in the last of seven events, the 800 metres, which came down to a shootout so epic it could have been directed by Sergio Leone.</p> <p>To win gold, Johnson-Thompson had to stay within three seconds of the brilliant young American Anna Hall. The problem? Hall’s personal best was five seconds faster.</p> <p>And so began a torturous two-lap examination of the Briton’s heart and lungs. Time and again, Hall kicked and silently asked her rival to quit. Yet Johnson-Thompson clung to her like a limpet.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/21/katarina-johnson-thompson-coach-put-her-through-a-lot-of-pain-world-championships-athletics\">‘Push through the pain barrier’: KJT and coach reveal her golden training runs | Sean Ingle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Two minutes and five seconds later, she tumbled over the line just behind Hall, with a two-second PB and another world title. It looked brutal, I say. She shakes her head. “There wasn’t a moment where I thought, ‘Oh God, no, she’s gonna win,’ she says. “I just knew.”</p> <p>Then comes another confession. “The most brutal part was actually the seven-hour wait between the end of the javelin and the starter saying ‘On your marks’ for the 800m,” she says.</p> <p>“Normally I’m a person who can sleep anywhere. And in Budapest I had these sleep goggles, meditation music and I was in a dark room. But I just couldn’t relax. All I could think about was all the different things that might happen. But my coach, Aston Moore, and my team played it perfectly. And when the 800m started I was back in the moment, back in control.”</p> <p>That was not the only moment of doubt during those world championships. There was a wobble after the 100m hurdles and the high jump on day one did not go completely to plan. “Even if everything’s all aligned and you have had a good preparation, sometimes you can talk yourself out of it on the day,” she says. “And I think there is an alternate universe where that probably happened. But I am living in this one where I was able to kick myself out of it.”</p> <p>A strong performance in shot put and a fast 200m, left her 93 points behind Hall after the first day. And then Johnson-Thompson engaged beast mode.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"34a6712ed79922649fe071f42ca7632f22fcfdb0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34a6712ed79922649fe071f42ca7632f22fcfdb0/0_211_5169_3101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katarina Johnson-Thompson competes in the shot put leg of heptathlon during day one of the world athletics championships in Budapest\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katarina Johnson-Thompson competes in the shot put in Budapest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Ramos/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I just turned up a different person on day two,” she says. “I was just on a mission. And you can see it. Each long jump went 10cm further. Then I got an outright PB in the javelin and 800m. I was just trying to squeeze out everything from my performances.”</p> <p>So what changed between 2022 and 2023? Johnson-Thompson credits the 67-year-old Moore, who took over her coaching duties last year, for getting her back to full physical fitness with the help of lung-busting 800m sessions in the depths of winter. Sometimes they were so tough Johnson-Thompson threw up. But it took a little longer for her mind to truly believe too.</p> <p>At this point, she goes back to May, when the Guardian was the only UK newspaper to travel to Götzis to see her open her outdoor season. “In 2021, I could point to the injury as explaining my performance,” she says. “While in 2022, I wasn’t motivated. However, I came into Götzis knowing that I was trying and I didn’t have any injuries. And so I was telling myself, ‘If this is a bad performance, I’m just a bad athlete now.’</p> <p>“There were no excuses basically. And it was so hard to put myself out there. In my head I was saying: ‘OK, maybe I’ll never be the same. Maybe the achilles rupture is a career-ending injury. And maybe I was just making excuses when I said I wasn’t truly trying last year.’ To truly put yourself out there was the scariest thing.”</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/28/johnson-thompson-can-see-a-path-back-after-second-place-finish-in-gotzis\" title=\"\">she did, and was able to reap the awards</a> – including being handed the female athlete of the year by the British Athletics Writers’ Association.

She has fond memories of watching the show with her grandfather and attending in 2010 and getting photos with everyone she recognised from TV – from top sports stars to James Corden. However, in 2019 she says she did not truly celebrate as she was so focused on the Tokyo Olympics – which were then cancelled three months later.

I know that if I didn’t have help I wouldn’t have made it to London 2012. And that kickstarted my career.”</p> <p>Inevitably her sights are already drifting towards Paris next year and one of the few things that has eluded her during her glittering career: an Olympic medal.</p> <p>This will be her fourth attempt, after an exciting debut in London and injury-marred shots at glory in Rio and Tokyo. And she knows that the competition is likely to be even hotter than in Budapest, with the double Olympic champion Nafi Thiam and the young Polish star Adrianna Sulek both expected to return from injury.</p> <p>“I’ve got unfinished business,” Johnson-Thompson says. “I know it’s going to be tough, and the heptathlon is so unpredictable, so my aim is just to get to the start line healthy.”</p> <p>Achieve that, though, and doubts can become dreams.

She seems extremely competent,” says Stephen Phipson, the chief executive of the manufacturing trade group Make UK.</p> \n<p>“What we’ve seen from the Labour party is a really strong commitment to making things in this country. We never saw that last week at the Tory conference. The whole thing about stability – it was perfect. We have been calling for this for years.”</p> \n<p>Here are five key conference takeaways for business:</p> \n<h2><strong>1. Labour is open for business</strong></h2> \n<p>Bookending Reeves’s speech with endorsements from shops guru Mary Portas, and former <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/oct/09/mark-carney-is-ace-in-rachel-reeves-already-strong-hand-against-tories-labour\">Bank of England governor Mark Carney</a>, marked a statement of intent from the shadow chancellor. Carney’s video message in particular resonated with business leaders. “It shows they are serious. It has not gone unnoticed,” said one senior executive from a large insurance business.</p> \n<p>Company bosses gathered for a meal in Liverpool’s famous Liver Building hosted by the City of London Corporation on Monday night, with Peter Mandelson – an ever-present figure this year – addressing the room to cement relations. Also present at conference were bosses from Shell, Taylor Wimpey and the insurer Lloyd’s of London.</p> \n<h2><strong>2. Reeves is opposed to tax increases</strong></h2> \n<p>Reeves had set the tone for the conference earlier this year, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/aug/27/rachel-reeves-rules-out-wealth-tax-if-labour-wins-next-election\">ruling out wealth taxes</a> and promising a review of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2023/mar/07/labours-messaging-on-business-tax-is-right-just-dont-leave-a-long-term-plan-until-the-last-minute\">business tax. </a>Labour has also committed to reforming business rates – a key demand made by industry groups. Portas welcomed this in particular, saying it would be a powerful tool for helping struggling high streets.</p> \n<p>The shadow chancellor used her speech to say Labour could not “tax and spend” its way to growth, saying instead that she wanted to “tax fairly and spend wisely”.</p> \n<p>Her reluctance to raise taxes on wealth is unpopular on the Labour left and among trade unions, who have been pushing for the rate at which capital gains are taxed to be increased in line with the taxes on salaries and other income.</p> \n<p>However, she told an event with Jim O’Neil, the crossbench peer and former Goldman Sachs chief economist, that it was important to incentivise entrepreneurs and businesses to invest in the UK.</p> \n<p>“We don’t plan a wholesale equalisation of income tax and capital gains. We think it is important to create the incentives to invest in UK businesses, to help create businesses, to help grow businesses, and to have preferential tax treatment in doing that.”</p> \n<h2><strong>3. … and backs spending discipline</strong></h2> \n<p>To underline Labour’s “ironclad” approach to sustainable tax and spending, Reeves announced reforms to strengthen the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government’s tax and spending watchdog. The measure received a loud round of applause in Reeves’ speech – a perhaps unexpected response for a dry policy change. </p> \n<p>Labour would pay for day-to-day spending through tax receipts, get debt down as a share of the economy, and then, “subject to that, invest in things that boost the potential of the economy”, she said. As part of spending money wisely, Reeves announced a review of HS2 cost overruns, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/oct/08/covid-corruption-commissioner-recoup-lost-billions-labour\">Covid corruption commissioner</a>, and limits on ministers travelling by private jet.</p> \n<h2><strong>4. Business investment is a Labour priority</strong></h2> \n<p>Labour plans an £8bn “national wealth fund” designed to coinvest public money alongside the private sector, with a focus on renewable energy and new technologies. Reeves said that for every £1 of public money spent, Labour wanted £3 from the private sector to ensure the state gets “bang for your buck”.</p> \n<p>The plans are based on Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, and aim to “de-risk” private sector investment in emerging technologies. </p> \n<p>Business leaders are broadly supportive, but details remain vague.</p> \n<h2><strong>5. Starmer wants to build, not block</strong></h2> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/oct/06/ive-gone-through-bereavement-hs2-bought-edward-cavenagh-mainwaring-land-for-what\">cancellation of HS2 </a>by Rishi Sunak angered many business leaders, but Labour failed to offer a firm promise to reinstate the high-speed rail line from Birmingham to Manchester. Instead, it used Sunak’s decision to highlight the government’s inability to build large infrastructure projects.</p> \n<p>With a large contingent from the rail industry at the conference, many business leaders were disappointed by the lack of a firm commitment to HS2. “It’s very frustrating,” said one senior industry figure. “The conversation is all about costs and not the missed £100bn a year economic upside.”</p> \n<p>However, Keir Starmer sought to position Labour as a party to “rebuild Britain”, announcing a raft of promises to “bulldoze” through the planning system to enable 1.5m new homes and the “next generation of Labour new towns”. Housing and property bosses welcomed his words: “We are encouraged by the moves which seek to deliver short, medium and long-term changes to unblock and reform the planning system,” says Greg Fitzgerald, the chief executive of housebuilder Vistry.</p> \n<p>Sir Nigel Wilson, group chief executive at Legal &amp; General, says: “We welcome Labour’s approach, which seeks to take a holistic view of these barriers to deliver ambitious outcomes.”</p>','2023-10-10 12:45:29',1,'2023-12-26 01:43:54','2023-12-26 01:43:54'),(569,'‘A treacherous business’: Joshua and Hearn left to rebuild shattered plans | Donald McRae','a-treacherous-business-joshua-and-hearn-left-to-rebuild-shattered-plans-donald-mcrae',394,1,78,'Anthony Joshua should have fought Deontay Wilder six years ago this month. In December 2017 Joshua held the IBF and WBA versions of the world heavyweight title and, after a remarkable victory over Wladimir Klitschko eight months earlier, his record was a flawless 19-0. He was 27 years old and at the peak of his profession. Wilder, with his 38-0 record including 37 victories by stoppage, was the WBC heavyweight champion and the most imposing knockout merchant on the planet. There was considerable risk in a unification fight, for both men, but they were in their physical and psychological prime as heavyweight champions and they would almost certainly have produced a riveting contest. Of course promotional rivalries, sanctioning body shenanigans and the rampant egos of boxing’s powerbrokers meant that the fight never happened.

In December 2017 Joshua held the IBF and WBA versions of the world heavyweight title and, after a remarkable victory over Wladimir Klitschko eight months earlier, his record was a flawless 19-0. He was 27 years old and at the peak of his profession. Wilder, with his 38-0 record including 37 victories by stoppage, was the WBC heavyweight champion and the most imposing knockout merchant on the planet.</p> \n<p>There was considerable risk in a unification fight, for both men, but they were in their physical and psychological prime as heavyweight champions and they would almost certainly have produced a riveting contest. Of course promotional rivalries, sanctioning body shenanigans and the rampant egos of boxing’s powerbrokers meant that the fight never happened. It was only this month that contracts were apparently signed by both Joshua and Wilder for them to meet in March 2024 in Riyadh.

One judge gave every round to Parker and the two other officials were accurate in their 118-111 and 118-110 scoring. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/dec/24/saudi-arabia-boxing-wilder-joshua\" title=\"\">Wilder, Joshua, their promoters</a> and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which believes that bankrolling boxing might help to obscure its appalling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/27/the-reality-behind-a-fight-in-saudi-arabia-human-rights-abuses-shadow-furys-visit\" title=\"\">human rights record</a>, have all been left to rue the harsh reality of heavyweight boxing.</p> \n<p>“He lost 120-108 [on one scorecard], he lost every round,” Eddie Hearn said of Wilder just after 3am on Sunday, local time. In his role as Joshua’s promoter, Hearn laid all the blame on Wilder. “It was the most one-sided heavyweight fight I’ve seen. Listen, it’s ruined our plans. The future is not Deontay Wilder. If anyone is going to ruin the plans, though, I’m delighted for Joseph Parker and [his trainer] Andy Lee. Top, top men.”</p> \n<p>Hearn was right to praise the admirable Parker, who avoided the threat of Wilder’s devastating right hand all night while following his trainer’s authoritative strategy. “Was it an upset?” Hearn said before he proceeded to trash Wilder’s reputation. “I don’t know but I’ve said before that this guy’s never beaten an elite heavyweight.”</p> \n<p>Wilder, however, had been an electrifying force in boxing. His highlight reel of knockouts might have included a string of journeymen – but so did Joe Louis’s “Bum of the Month Club” in the late 1930s and 1940s when that great world champion laid waste to the heavyweight division. And Wilder’s epic trilogy of fights with Tyson Fury – in which he knocked down the “Gypsy King” four times – showed the courage and power of both men in an unforgettable series of world title fights. Wilder and Fury were made for each other, and they were compelling dance partners, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/oct/10/tyson-fury-beats-deontay-wilder-wbc-heavyweight-title-fight-boxing\" title=\"\">the cost of their rivalry</a> was clear in the way that the American looked a ghost of his former self against Parker.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0c4f35f3a0ff68249424d12eb64b58e1a373f1af\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c4f35f3a0ff68249424d12eb64b58e1a373f1af/0_0_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A demoralised Deontay Wilder leaves the ring\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A demoralised Deontay Wilder leaves the ring.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Robinson/Matchroom Boxing/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Hearn chose next to elevate Joshua to new heights of hyperbole after he dominated Otto Wallin, who was rescued by his corner at the end of the fifth round in Riyadh. “Anthony Joshua is leagues above Deontay Wilder,” Hearn said, even though their proposed showdown in March had been marketed for months as one of boxing’s definitive encounters. “I believe this Anthony Joshua is the best heavyweight in the world. That was a punch-perfect performance, a stunning performance. One that says he is back. With this mindset I think he is unbeatable: 2024 will be massive for him.”</p> \n<p>Joshua looked more impressive and concentrated in the ring than he has done in years. Yet Wallin is a limited opponent and, before the fight, it was clear that the most worrying aspects for those who admire Joshua centred on the uncertain state of his mind. After being knocked out by Andy Ruiz Jr in 2019, who he then outpointed in an ultra-cautious rematch six months later, Joshua lost twice in a row to the far more naturally gifted Oleksandr Usyk, who came up from cruiserweight to make him look such a flawed former champion.</p> \n<p>Joshua spoke sensibly after the fight when he pointed out that boxing is “a treacherous business. It’s like snakes and ladders – one win gets you up the ladder and a [loss] takes you all the way back down”.</p> \n<p>Hearn, of course, has a new plan. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/nov/02/tyson-fury-v-oleksandr-usyk-world-title-fight-pushed-back-to-early-next-year\" title=\"\">In February, Fury and Usyk</a> meet in boxing’s first world heavyweight title unification bout since 1999 when Lennox Lewis was the last undisputed champion. But Hearn is banking on the fact that the IBF, one of the four main sanctioning bodies, will strip the new champion of its belt if he does not agree to an immediate match with its mandatory contender, Filip Hrgovic from Croatia. It is likely that Fury and Usyk would prefer a far more lucrative rematch than face the still relatively obscure Hrgovic.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c09b0ae0-ebd0-44f1-8bd5-0575bdab4478\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d7zrOMtgTTs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The way will then be clear, in Hearn’s latest grand plan, for Joshua to fight Hrgovic for the vacant IBF bauble. “He wants to become a three-time heavyweight world champion,” the promoter said of Joshua. “It will be Filip Hrgovic against AJ for the world title.”</p> \n<p>That imagined fight does not have the ring of Fury v Usyk nor the resonance that Joshua v Wilder carried before Saudi Arabia’s much trumpeted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/dec/24/saudi-arabia-boxing-wilder-joshua\" title=\"\">Day of Reckoning</a> obliterated those plans. Parker, the unheralded but likable New Zealander, simply smiled amid the madness of boxing. “Everyone had other plans, but this is God’s plan. I was really fit. I stayed calm, relaxed, focused. There are always things to work on but I got the win. Merry Christmas to us.”</p>','2023-12-25 05:00:19',1,'2023-12-26 01:43:55','2023-12-26 01:43:55'),(570,'UK business secretary Kemi Badenoch turns down CBI invitation','uk-business-secretary-kemi-badenoch-turns-down-cbi-invitation',395,1,78,'The business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, has reportedly dealt another blow to the scandal-hit Confederation of British Industry (CBI) by turning down an invitation to speak at the lobby group’s annual conference.

One-third of the UK bee population has disappeared in the last decade, and since 1900 the UK has lost 13 out of 35 native bee species.</p> <p>“Many UK businesses rely on a healthy pollinator population to uphold the high standards of our products.

However, the pesticide spreads into the soil, meaning any wildflower that grows in it is toxic to the bees that visit to pollinate.</p> <p>Farming unions and sugar beet growers have been lobbying the government to allow for Cruiser SB to be used next year, and it is thought ministers are likely to approve its emergency use.</p> <p>Kindersley said: “Bees and other critical pollinators are being endangered simply to grow slightly cheaper sugar.

Among those expected to be at the UK global summit are a long list of tech executives in addition to global leaders. In the US, Senator Chuck Schumer has now hosted two closed-door meetings with mostly tech industry representatives. The first, held in September, focused on national security, privacy issues and high-risk AI systems and included Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI; Elon Musk; and Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google, as guests. The second, held <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/pro/tech-policy/2023/10/13/exclusive-details-on-schumers-next-ai-forum\">on 24 October</a> and focused on innovation, was attended by a mix of tech venture capitalists, investors and a few academics.</p> <p>The summit and these discussions fail to address the “clear and present danger” of AI and give big tech a forum to push for self-regulation and voluntary commitments, say a group of experts who organized a counter-summit on Monday. AI ethicists and critics including Amba Kak, the executive director of the AI Now Institute; Safiya Noble, the founder of the Center on Race &amp; Digital Justice; Maria Ressa, a journalist and member of the Real Facebook Oversight Board, spoke at The People’s Summit for AI Safety, a press conference that would serve as an “antidote” to the UK summit. “The UK government has listened to companies opting for self-regulation,” said Marietje Schaake, a former MEP and the special advisory to the European Commission implementing the Digital Services Act. “The Summit missed out on inviting a wider representation of experts and people impacted by AI-driven disruption.” </p> <p>The disproportionate focus on tech leaders’ perspectives has also allowed for an unhelpful framework on how regulation could affect innovation to take root, said Callie Schroeder, a senior counsel and global privacy counsel at the non-profit Electronic Privacy Information Center. </p> <p>“They still have it a little bit set up in their head that this is a game of privacy and consumer protection versus innovation when it doesn’t have to be confrontational that way,” Schroeder said. “There are absolutely ways to develop innovative new technology while also paying attention to risks.”</p> <p>The spokesperson for the Department of Science, Innovation and Technology said the summit will “bring together a wide array of attendees including international governments, academia, industry and civil society” in an effort to “drive targeted, rapid international action” on the responsible development of AI.</p> <p>Both countries are also motivated in part by a desire to compete on a global scale. For the US, that competition is driven in part by fears that countries like China could move more quickly to develop AI systems that could be used in a way that poses national security threats. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/13/artificial-intelligence-us-regulation\">In a 6 June letter</a>, Schumer and other lawmakers invited members of Congress to discuss the “extraordinary potential, and risks, AI presents”. The topics included how to maintain US leadership in AI and how the country’s “adversaries” use AI. The Senate select committee on intelligence has since <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgNBDjNY0sU\">held a hearing on the national security implications</a> of AI that included testimony from Yann LeCun, the vice-president and chief AI scientist at Meta. (China, for its part, has <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/ai-china-regulations-free-speech-baidu-ernie-chatgpt-1850329689\">proposed</a> guidelines that would prohibit large language models from producing content that could be seen as critical of the government.)</p> <p>Sunak, who faces a general election next year, has emphasized the UK’s position as an intellectual leader in AI. “You would be hard-pressed to find many other countries other than the US in the western world with more expertise and talent in AI,” Sunak <a href=\"https://time.com/6287253/uk-rishi-sunak-ai-regulation/\">said</a> during a recent visit to Washington DC.</p> <p>***</p> <p>When it comes to AI regulation, experts argue the UK is looking to distinguish itself from the EU post-Brexit.</p> <p>“What the UK does on AI to a certain extent, has to respond to what the EU does,” said<strong> </strong>Oliver Marsh, a project lead at the human rights organization AlgorithmWatch. “If the UK looks at what the EU does and says that’s really sensible, then that is kind of a problem for politicians who want to claim the UK can do things better than the EU.” Simultaneously, any radical deviation by the UK will throw existing scientific collaborations into chaos, according to Marsh.<strong> </strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/24/hope-or-horror-the-great-ai-debate-dividing-its-pioneers\">Hope or horror?

As a result, civil society groups were able to successfully focus legislative attention on existing harms and pushed for language that requires transparency around law enforcement use of “high-risk” AI both in policing and migration control. The EU is in the midst of hammering out some of the final details of the bill after years of development – those involved had a 25 October deadline to finalize how the legislation handles questions of police surveillance and generative AI.</p> <p>But the EU has not been immune to the hype of generative AI, said Sarah Chander, a senior policy analyst at European Digital Rights (EDRi). EU member states are currently pushing back on those transparency proposals around police use of AI and looking to relitigate how to decide what is considered high risk. </p> <p>“We think it’s important to look at the infrastructural, economic and environmental concerns when it comes to general purpose AI, but that hype has directed attention away from [our original priorities], and has allowed member states in the EU to deprioritize the question of the law enforcement,” said Chander.</p> <p>As the EU races to be the first to establish AI regulations, experts continue to push the US and UK to refocus their efforts on creating meaningful legislation that addresses existing AI harms.</p> <p>“The frontier is here,” said Clara Maguire the executive director of the non-profit journalism organization the Citizens. “We are witnessing the weaponization of AI today, enabled by many of the companies with leaders attending Prime Minister Sunak’s summit.”</p>','2023-10-31 00:00:35',1,'2023-12-26 01:44:01','2023-12-26 01:44:01'),(575,'From Wonka to Nicki Minaj: a complete guide to this week’s entertainment','from-wonka-to-nicki-minaj-a-complete-guide-to-this-weeks-entertainment',392,2,78,'Going out: Cinema Earth Mama Out now Based on the short film The Heart Still Hums by Savanah Leaf and Taylor Russell, this drama, written and directed by Leaf, explores the realities of single motherhood through the eyes of Gia (Tia Nomore), a pregnant woman in San Francisco’s Bay Area attempting to regain custody of her two children, who have been placed in foster care.

As was the rather insulting compensatory offer of $200 (£160) to spend in the Las Vegas GP shop, given the cost of tickets. A lawsuit has since been filed seeking damages for the 35,000 spectators who were left feeling it was scant response.</p> \n<p>Local discontent also grumbled on throughout the weekend. Small businesses and workers were put out by the disruption imposed on the city. Some cited commutes increasing by over two hours, while others complained that the circuit restraints had funnelled customers away from their businesses.</p> \n<p>Then there were the session times: qualifying at midnight and the race at 10pm. They were decided in a compromise with the city to minimise disruption when the roads were closed but were brutal on the teams. In the paddock, the sight of bleary-eyed personnel spoke volumes, and concerns were raised by a slew of team principals and drivers.</p> \n<p>All of which can be addressed before next year and could be improved. In the meantime, the city will assess whether the deal worked for it as well as F1. An increase in revenue of between $1bn and $1.7bn has been predicted and, if the race makes those numbers, Vegas and the sport will probably continue for at least the 10 years of the current deal.</p> \n<p>There should also be some pride in having pulled it all off in a relatively short time since the race was confirmed in March 2022. The logistics were immense and a lot of effort and money was spent on making it work. Illustrated at a practical level, on a walk from one part of the track to another, the number of workers directing traffic and marshalling people was staggering. Barely 50 feet would pass without a (usually) friendly face waving punters on, or back, with a glowstick.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"20243f02-68c9-4ab5-a337-d597159cfcd0\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kSYi7sidM4M?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Equally in the fan areas there were many staff on hand – not four surly teenagers wearing hi-vis and moodily sucking on Gauloises, as at some European races, but employees in the hundreds holding up signs that lit up to read: “Can I help?”</p> \n<p>Alongside the garish and the cliched which is part and parcel of the city – a wedding chapel in the paddock and endless Elvis impersonators – there were little touches too. On the teams’ hospitality units their logos were rendered in glorious retro-Vegas style neon signs.</p> \n<p>None of this came cheap, of course, and F1 is expected to be out by as much as $700m. Yet that is a one-off and included investment in resurfacing the track and buying the land on which to build a pit and paddock complex that will now be repurposed for the rest of the year as F1’s US headquarters and with a further function to be announced later this week.</p> \n<p>Which partly explains the other major bone of contention, that of ticket prices. The average price for a three-day ticket was $1,667 (£1,332). A factor, perhaps, in it not reaching a sellout of 105,000. This, too, might be addressed with a no-frills stand at a more reasonable cost.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2023/nov/19/las-vegas-grand-prix-formula-one\">Las Vegas Grand Prix: F1 hits Sin City – in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Imagine the equivalent of the great Rivazza corner at Imola, a heaving pyramid of fans in the heart of Vegas.

I’ll stay in the stalls for a medley of seasonal songs performed by Olivier award-winner Miriam-Teak Lee, or the Apollo 8 Christmas Eve message rendered as heroic storytelling, or a reenactment by a cast of four of the Christmas truce on the western front in 1914. Impossible to watch a Curtis-scripted take on the latter without thinking of his great Blackadder joke on the subject: “I was <em>never</em> offside!” There’s nothing that funny here, all evening. But the trenches scene is nicely, lightly done.</p> <p>Not everything is that successful. The show is a compendium of sketches, “Christmas stories”, celebrity inserts on video (the England football squad telling Christmas cracker jokes, anyone?) and songs. The comedy is weak. There’s a 12 Days of Christmas sketch that establishes its premise early and offers no further surprises. There’s a “nativity as written by ChatGPT” skit that doesn’t seem to understand how ChatGPT works. We’re repeatedly invited to laugh at the cheap, “poor theatre” stylings – Bhaskar having to play all the parts in A Christmas Carol, say – which doesn’t fly given the opulent context and £100+ ticket prices.</p> <p>You expect hit-and-miss in variety, of course, and we get plenty of the latter this evening, as celebrity guest Fiona Bruce shows up to, er, lob some white balloons into the crowd, and our MCs narrate micro-documentaries on this or that glowing example of Christmas charity (Band Aid; New York nonprofit Miracle on 22nd Street) gone by.</p> <p>But for all the creakiness of this festive contrivance, I can’t get too Scrooge-like about Christmas Actually. It throws a lot at the wall, some of it falls apart on impact – but some of it captures the spirit of the season, like the Battersea Christmas choir assembling for a round of White Christmas, or the “kids say the funniest things” letters to Santa interlude, or Tim Minchin’s lovely humanist carol <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCNvZqpa-7Q\">White Wine in the Sun</a>, which Adams delivers with understated grace.

While Bird’s primary sensation might be dread, for the reader the story is great fun.</p> <p>It’s simply pleasurable to read a writer who has found her groove and produces smart, riveting and (seemingly) effortless entertainment. <em>Apple Tree Yard</em> was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/30/apple-tree-yard-is-this-the-first-honest-portrayal-of-rape-on-tv-emily-watson\">adapted by the BBC</a>, which also made <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/sep/25/the-queens-funeral-bbc-tv-review-crossfire-bloodlands-am-i-being-unreasonable\">Crossfire</a></em>, the series she created and wrote. Inevitably, I found myself playing fantasy casting and considering various grimly telegenic crime locations while reading <em>A Bird </em><em>in Winter</em>.

I was always transparent about that then, almost too transparent, and I am being transparent about it now as well.”</p> \n<p>Despite the allegations, Brand performed a show in London on Saturday night, telling the audience: “There’s some things I cannot talk about and hopefully you appreciate that.

So now enters a modern concern: how to pick the right TV. In a world where most of our digital devices are quirky hybrids of online directory, hi-tech camera and ultra-speed search engine, TVs have also upped their game and not just in sound and vision. They store your favourite shows, so you can restart them when you like, as well as giving intelligent recommendations – they’re <em>smart. </em>But what if they could also take calls, respond to your voice, and sometimes even talk back? Well, the <em>smarter </em>TV from Sky can.</p> <p>Picking the best smart TV is an exercise in considering your needs against an overwhelming range on the market. So what factors should you be thinking about? Most people consider aspects such as ease of use, tech-and-hardware specs, availability of nifty features and whether what you’d usually watch is compatible with any inbuilt app systems.</p> <p>The best smart TV will be one that likely combines features such as all your apps in one place for ease of access, prioritised by most TV fans. For example, the Sky Glass television is perfect for the age of streaming because it’s a device that comes with Sky’s services and live television inbuilt to save faffing around purchasing services separately.</p> <p><strong>Cutting-edge technology<br></strong>The name of the game with your smart TV should be advancements (it is smart, after all). These types of models are designed to be cutting-edge, so certain features and hardware – 4K Ultra HD resolution, 360-degree Dolby Atmos sound, eye-catching colourways – can all be found with Sky Glass – a device that that’s smarter than the normal smart TV because it has automatic updates, meaning it’s built for the future. Plus, there’s ample warranty in case a jumping jack little one knocks it over (can’t be too careful).</p> <p>Then there’s familiarity. Think about what you like to watch and the importance of certain channels, whether you have a preference for live TV or streaming etc. These will all help you decide what apps need to be able to work with your television when you buy a new model.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/smarter-than-a-smart-tv/2023/nov/24/we-had-a-small-wooden-box-why-a-tv-can-make-or-break-your-enjoyment-of-this-winters-sporting-events\">‘We had a small wooden box’: why a TV can make (or break) your enjoyment of this winter’s sporting events</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Keep the kids entertained<br></strong>It makes sense to get a model that will fit around your lifestyle. If you have kids or a large family, the TV can be a useful tool in getting certain members distracted and allowing oneself the occasional bit of peace and quiet. A shiny television or quirky added feature can possess almost supernatural powers to grab attention if picked correctly. Best to go with a model where games can be played, or with a form of inbuilt arcade system that will definitely keep little hands busy. The Sky Live camera, that sits on top of your TV and is exclusive to Sky Glass, lets you video call, watch movies from different households and play a range of immersive games.</p> <p><strong>Carbon-conscious<br></strong>We are also in the era of the climate-conscious TV user. Once an afterthought, I’m sure most of us at least slightly bristle leaving the little red standby light on. Sky has done a one-up; the Sky Glass is certified as “CarbonNeutral” rated by the CarbonNeutral Protocol, and the packaging is plastic-free and recyclable, so you can make steps to do your part around environmental impact.</p> <p>Once you have your TV model, it’s a case of where to put it. Mounted maybe? Or freestanding, which can help it sit at the perfect eye level so you don’t crick your neck. Either way, I’d bet that<strong> </strong>Sky Glass will surely be one of the most entertaining gadgets in your home. And on that note … I’m off to watch EastEnders.</p> <p><em>If you’re looking to upgrade to a new smarter than smart TV, check out Sky Glass <a href=\"https://www.sky.com/glass?utm_source=Guardian&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_id=sky_glass_2\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a></em></p>','2023-11-24 09:42:41',1,'2023-12-26 01:44:13','2023-12-26 01:44:13'),(584,'From Golda to Frasier: a complete guide to this week’s entertainment','from-golda-to-frasier-a-complete-guide-to-this-weeks-entertainment',392,2,78,'Going out: Cinema Golda Out now Starring Helen Mirren as Israeli prime minister Golda Meir, this biopic from Guy Nattiv focuses on Meir’s premiership during the Yom Kippur war in the 1970s.

He fought until the surrender at Appomattox, then allied himself with those who had brought about his defeat: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/oct/08/klan-war-ulysses-s-grant-book-fergus-bordewich\">Ulysses S Grant</a> and the Republican party.</p> <p>“He was not the only one,” Varon says of white southern Republicans who made such moves, “but [he was] the highest-ranking Confederate. He was a lightning rod for critics.”</p> <p>Prominent figures such as Lee were honored with monuments, some of which have recently been pulled down. Longstreet never had this problem, because you’d be hard-pressed to find such tributes to him.</p> <p>“It’s quite astounding,” Varon reflects. “Longstreet endorses Reconstruction at a time when the vast majority of white southern former Confederates pledged themselves to resist at all costs.”</p> <p>The author is interested in such dissenters. A previous book chronicled Elizabeth Van Lew, a resident of the Confederate capital, Richmond, who spied for the Union. Varon hopes a future scholar will write about another dissenter, Longstreet’s much younger second wife, Helen Longstreet, née Dortch, who outlived her husband by 58 years. By the 20th century, she was also an outspoken voice for civil rights in the south.</p> <p>Dissent characterized Longstreet’s war years as much as his later life did. The 1993 film Gettysburg dramatizes his dispute with Lee at that famous battle. Longstreet argued for a defensive approach. Lee took the offense and the result was a disaster, a turning point in the war. Transferred west, Longstreet led an assault credited for the victory at Chickamauga, then lambasted his new commander, Braxton Bragg, for his failure to capitalize. Longstreet would later suffer for daring to criticize Lee.</p> <p>Although Varon addresses Longstreet’s war years, she is more interested in his postwar career, which stretched for nearly four decades and included leadership positions in Louisiana and Georgia. He even became the US minister to the Ottoman empire, where he met Sultan Abdul Hamid II and defended American missionaries.</p> <p>He owed much of his success to an improbable allegiance to the abolitionist Republican party of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/19/the-lincoln-shiver-soldiers-home-cottage-washington\">Abraham Lincoln</a> and a lasting friendship with Grant.</p> <p>Varon details an unconventional but unsuccessful peace initiative involving the Grant and Longstreet families near the end of the civil war. (The war years had been hard for Longstreet and his first wife, Louise Longstreet. They lost three children to scarlet fever in 1862, and two years later, the general was grievously wounded by his own men.) At Appomattox, Longstreet was impressed by Grant’s lenient terms, which helped convince him it was time to change. He explained his stance in a series of 1867 letters that were poorly received by many.</p> <p>As Varon explains: “Longstreet said, ‘Yes, let’s give the Republican party a chance, try to make this work, we appealed to arms and the sword to arbitrate the political conflict with the north, they won, now it … requires me to try to make the best of it.’”</p> <p>She adds: “He was absolutely thrown back on his heels by the backlash by ex-Confederates. For his willingness to work with the Republicans, he was called anathema, a Judas, Lucifer, Benedict Arnold, they wished he’d died during the war.”</p> <p>A new battle began, a war of words with fellow former commanders such as Jubal Early, over who was responsible for the defeat. Yet Longstreet was committed to Reconstruction and the Republicans and to his postwar home, New Orleans, a racially diverse city where he held political positions following Grant’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/oct/08/klan-war-ulysses-s-grant-book-fergus-bordewich\">election as president in 1868</a>, beginning at the customs house. Through such positions, which extended to militia and police leadership, Longstreet advocated some degree of civil rights. Allies included PBS Pinchback, who in 1872 became the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2023/01/18/black-governors-history-wes-moore/\">first sworn-in Black governor</a> of a US state.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"16d6cdab5b37de32cfc0a33507cb71c617118653\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16d6cdab5b37de32cfc0a33507cb71c617118653/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A dark bronze statue without a base, of a man in a hat on a horse, directly on the ground covered with brown fall leaves.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Few statues to Longstreet exist. This one is in Pitzer Woods, at Gettysburg National Military Park in Pennsylvania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Walt Bilous/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In addition to Longstreet’s personal life and recognition of the flawed rebel war effort, Varon identifies “the last element” in his turnaround as “New Orleans itself – a unique political environment”. She cites the city’s Afro-Creole male leadership class, many of whom served as officers in the Union army.</p> <p>“They were politically savvy, assertive men,” Varon says, “really pushing for votes and full civil, economic and social rights for Blacks in Louisiana.” Regarding Longstreet, she notes: “I don’t think it would have turned out the same if [he] was somewhere else in the postwar south. This particular setting was uniquely positioned to change his views on race.”</p> <p>•••</p> <p>By 1874, that change was profound. On George Washington’s birthday, Longstreet participated in a review of interracial troops. Racist white discontent was simmering, in part over a disputed election two years earlier: after the Republicans were declared to have won, Democrats set up a rival government, followed by a takeover attempt and a massacre of Black people at Colfax. Another slaughter of Black people followed, in Coushatta in the summer of 1874.

Callaghan, Major and Brown did that – and all three lost. Callaghan ran into the 1978-9 winter of discontent, Brown the global financial crisis of 2008. Major never recovered from presiding over the pound’s departure from the exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday in September 1992.</p> <p>Hunt says the timing of the NI move has nothing to do with the Conservative party’s election strategy but it certainly leaves the door open for a spring poll should things slot into place. Sunak hopes two months in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/20/uk-inflation-cost-of-living-crisis\">inflation has fallen more sharply than expected to stand at 3.9%</a> and the NI cut will persuade voters that the cost of living crisis is over, giving the Conservatives a potential uplift going into what is almost certain to be an election year.</p> <p>Stage 2 of the May election strategy would involve an early budget, perhaps slotted in by the end of February at which Hunt would announce income tax cuts. Parliament would be dissolved shortly afterwards.</p> <p>One factor to be taken into account is the sharp rise in monthly mortgage payments faced by homebuyers. Almost three-quarters of homebuyers (74%) are on <a href=\"https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/news-and-insight/blogs/how-the-bank-rate-affects-mortgage-rates#:~:text=Currently%2C%2074%20per%20cent%20of,as%20shown%20in%20Chart%202).\">fixed-rate home loans</a>, rising to 96% for those who have taken out a mortgage since 2019. These deals have so far limited the impact of the 14 increases in official interest rates from the Bank of England since December 2021 but are now expiring for many borrowers.</p> <p>George Dibb, and associate director for economic policy at the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank, says 120,000 people a month are coming to the end of fixed-rate mortgages, most of them taken out before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered a fresh upward lurch in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/28/uk-food-prices-soar-by-record-106-as-russia-ukraine-war-pushes-up-costs\">inflation</a>. “People who were paying 2% mortgage rates are going to be paying 5% mortgage rates and will feel the cost of living squeeze anew,” he says.</p> <p>Despite the fact that the impact of dearer home loans will affect more and more households over time, Dibb thinks the government will hang on in the hope that interest rates come down as 2024 wears on. After October’s weak growth and the unexpectedly sharp drop in inflation, the financial markets are pricing in five quarter-point cuts from the Bank of England by the end of next year, taking the base rate from 5.25% to 4%. That would still leave them well above the record 2020-21 low of 0.1%.</p> <p>Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, also thinks Sunak will decide against an early election: “The bottom line when it comes to the economy is that it looks better for the government the later it leaves it.”</p> <p>The economy is flatlining and Dales expects it to remain weak over the winter and into the spring. “In the first half of 2024 growth will be soggy and might even be negative. Unemployment may creep up and consumer confidence will be low. Towards the end of the year things will be better. The economy is not going to be off to the races but it will be growing at a faster rate.”</p> <p>Dales says there had been a strong link between consumer confidence and voting intentions stretching back to the 1970 election. When confidence was high, the incumbent government was re-elected; when it was low it lost. The relationship sometimes breaks down. In 1997, the mood was buoyant but Major lost by a landslide. But Dales says there is a possibility consumer confidence – now extremely weak – will have recovered sufficiently in a year’s time to give Sunak a chance of winning.</p> <p>Consumers tend to be happier if their pay packets stretch further and for much of the period since the 2019 election that has not be the case. For the past two years prices have been rising faster than wages and – as the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, points out – this is to be the first parliament in modern times where living standards will have fallen.</p> <p>In recent months, prices have been growing less rapidly than earnings, increasing spending power. But it is likely to take some time for consumers to detect any real improvement in their purchasing power and the pickup in living standards may have come too late to affect the election result. The longer Sunak leaves it the greater the chance of a modest feelgood factor and while that might not be enough to prevent a Labour victory, it might reduce Starmer’s majority.</p> <p>The pollster Peter Kellner thinks the polls – which show Labour with a lead of 20% plus – would need to narrow a lot for the prime minster to risk an early election. “If Labour still has a double-digit poll lead by the middle of March, Sunak’s choice will be accepting defeat in May against the tiny chance of avoiding defeat later. It is probably the case that the longer he hangs on the worse it will be but even if there is only a remote prospect of victory he will hang on,” says Kellner.</p> <p>One risk of waiting until late next year in the hope that something will turn up is that it leaves the government exposed to events, highlighted by Sunak’s problems this week with his Rwanda asylum-seeker plan. There have been two nasty shocks to the economy since 2019 – the global pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine – and the chances of the UK being hit by a third crisis increases the longer that Sunak leaves it.</p> <p>Nick Timothy, one of Theresa May’s special advisers when she plumped for an early election in 2017 and lost the Conservative’s overall majority, says he can see the argument in favour of an early election but thinks it is highly unlikely that Sunak would go for one.</p> <p>“There is chatter about May and I know there is a logic to it. We do badly in the local government elections and struggle on through the summer. But psychologically it is very hard for a prime minister to go for an early election with the polls the way they are,” says Timothy, who is standing as the Conservative candidate for West Suffolk at the next election.</p>','2023-12-21 02:00:19',1,'2023-12-26 01:44:20','2023-12-26 01:44:20'),(589,'UN general assembly calls for immediate truce – as it happened','un-general-assembly-calls-for-immediate-truce-as-it-happened',409,3,77,'This is where we’ll wrap up this blog and continue our rolling live coverage on a new blog here.

attacks</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A recap on the situation in Gaza right now: Israel knocked out the internet and communications in the blockaded territory in a stepped-up bombardment during Friday night, largely cutting off its 2.3 million people from contact with each other and the outside world and creating a near-blackout of information, Associated Press reports. </p> \n  <p>The Israeli military said it was “expanding” ground operations in the territory, in an announcement signalling it was moving closer to an all-out invasion of Gaza.</p> \n  <p>Explosions from continuous airstrikes lit up the sky over Gaza City for hours after nightfall. The Palestinian telecom provider, Paltel, said the bombardment caused “complete disruption” of internet, cellular and landline services. The cutoff meant that casualties from strikes and details of ground incursions could not immediately be known. Some satellite phones continued to function.</p> \n  <p>Already plunged into darkness after most electricity was cut off weeks ago, Palestinians were thrown into isolation, huddling in homes and shelters with food and water supplies running out.</p> \n  <p>Relatives outside Gaza panicked after their messaging chats with families inside suddenly went dead and calls stopped going through.</p> \n  <p>“I was so scared this was going to happen,” said Wafaa Abdul Rahman, director of a feminist organisation based in the West Bank city of Ramallah. She said she hadn’t heard for hours from family in central Gaza.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2023-10-28T01:14:28.040Z\">at 2.14am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-653c482b8f0880c2481911bc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2023-10-27T23:46:04.452Z\">12.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Before the White House’s latest comments on its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/oct/27/israel-hamas-war-live-us-strikes-iran-linked-targets-in-syria-eu-calls-for-humanitarian-pauses-in-gaza?CMP=share_btn_tw&amp;page=with%3Ablock-653c46968f0837aa4c22c4fb#block-653c46968f0837aa4c22c4fb\">strikes on Syrian sites</a> it said were used by Iranian-linked militias, it said Joe Biden had relayed a direct warning to Iran’s supreme leader, <strong>Ayatollah Ali Khamenei</strong>, against militias striking US troops in Syria and Iraq.</p> \n  <p>The US forces are stationed as part of efforts against the Islamic State group, which also has clashed with Iran, Agence France-Presse reports.</p> \n  <p>There have been at least 14 attacks on US and allied forces in Iraq and six in Syria since 17 October, a period in which 21 US military personnel suffered minor injuries and one contractor died from a cardiac incident, according to the Pentagon.</p> \n  <p>The US strikes on Thursday were the first on Iranian interests since March, breaking a stretch of calm after the Biden administration opened quiet diplomacy with the US arch-enemy that led to a prisoner swap and conversations on Iran’s disputed nuclear program.</p> \n  <p>The defense secretary <strong>Lloyd Austin</strong> said the strikes were “narrowly tailored” to protect US personnel and were “separate and distinct from the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas”.</p> \n  <p>The Pentagon said on Friday evening that its current assessment was the strikes did not cause casualties.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2023-10-27T23:59:04.484Z\">at 12.59am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-653c46968f0837aa4c22c4fb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2023-10-27T23:28:02.610Z\">12.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The United States has said it sought to degrade ammunition supplies of Iranian-linked militias with strikes in Syria but insisted it did not want to widen the Middle East conflict.</p> \n  <p>Agence France-Presse reports that the Pentagon on Thursday announced air strikes on two sites in eastern Syria it said were used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) after a string of attacks on US forces in Iraq and Syria since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.</p> \n  <p>John Kirby, the US national security council spokesman, told reporters on Friday:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The purpose for those two sites that we targeted was to have a significant impact on future IRGC and Iran-backed militia group operations</p> \n   <p>It went right at storage facilities and ammo depots that we know will be used to support the work of these militia groups, particularly in Syria.</p> \n   <p>The main goal was to disrupt that ability and also to deter – to prevent – future attacks.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><p>This is Adam Fulton picking up our rolling live coverage of the Israel-Hamas war.

While the PSOE and Sumar have fewer seats than the PP and Vox, they have more options when it comes to doing deals to win the support of smaller parties as they endeavour to form a new government.</p> \n<h2>What happens next?</h2> \n<p>Both the PP’s leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, and Sánchez are going to try to put together new governments over the coming weeks. Congress will convene on 17 August and King Felipe VI will then meet party leaders to determine which candidate could win MPs’ backing to become the next prime minister. That candidate would then take part in an investiture debate followed by a vote that requires an absolute majority in Spain’s lower house (the aforementioned 176 seats). If the candidate falls short of that number, a second vote will be held 48 hours later in which a simple majority – more votes for than against – will suffice. Should that fail to happen, MPs have two months to appoint a prime minister. When those two months are up, parliament will be dissolved and new elections called for the end of the year.</p> \n<h2>So who is most likely to be able to pull together a government?</h2> \n<p>Sánchez and his allies.

And any attempt by Feijóo to try to forge a minority government would be sunk by the PSOE’s refusal to back it or to abstain to allow it into office.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"302d46c4d289709f9fe170eba3b61047dcd55464\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/302d46c4d289709f9fe170eba3b61047dcd55464/0_183_5472_3282/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pedro Sánchez in Madrid on election night\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pedro Sánchez (second right) in Madrid on election night.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juan Carlos Rojas/LaPresse/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>What are Sánchez’s options?</h2> \n<p>By enlisting the support of smaller regional parties, including the separatist Catalan Republican Left party and the pro-independence Basque party EH Bildu, the PSOE leader could potentially secure the backing of 172 MPs – enough to get him over the line in a second investiture debate. But Sánchez would also need to negotiate a deal to ensure the abstention of Junts, the hardline, centre-right pro-independence party of the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont. In another of the election’s many twists of fate, Puigdemont’s party – which spearheaded the unsuccessful push to secede from the rest of Spain almost six years ago – could find itself playing kingmaker. “We won’t make Pedro Sánchez PM in exchange for nothing,” its leader, Míriam Nogueras, warned on Sunday night.</p> \n<p>While the PSOE may have a numerical advantage over the PP, deals with Catalan and Basque independence parties would play neatly into the hands of Sánchez’s rivals, who accuse him of being far too reliant on them. The campaign for May’s elections was dominated by the legacy of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/28/spain-election-rows-over-eta-and-allegations-of-fraud\">defunct Basque terrorist group Eta</a> after it emerged that EH Bildu – whose support the Sánchez government has enlisted in congress – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/14/spanish-pm-offers-2-cinema-tickets-for-over-65s-ahead-of-regional-elections\">was fielding 44 convicted Eta members</a>, including seven people found guilty of violent crimes, as candidates.</p> \n<p>Sánchez criticised Bildu’s decision – describing it as legal but “obviously indecent” – but it was swiftly seized on by his opponents, who have also attacked his government over its botched sexual offences reforms, which have led to more than 100 convicted sex offenders being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/16/spanish-pm-apologises-loophole-sexual-consent-law\">granted early release</a>.</p> \n<p>“You’re the great electoral hope for rapists and pederasts, for mutineers, squatters, corrupt people, and now for those who used to go about in balaclavas with pistols,” Feijóo told Sánchez. “And I will never be that.”</p> \n<h2>What’s the most likely outcome?</h2> \n<p>As the PP has once again learned to its cost, it never pays to bet against Sánchez. That said, the coming weeks and months are unlikely to be easy for the socialists and their allies as they try to put together a new government. Spanish politics continues to be fragmented and another general election remains a distinct possibility. It’s also worth bearing in mind that Sunday’s vote means that the last five Spanish general elections have resulted in hung parliaments.</p>','2023-07-24 05:22:50',1,'2023-12-26 01:44:26','2023-12-26 01:44:26'),(594,'Mark Milley: retiring general appears to call Trump ‘wannabe dictator’','mark-milley-retiring-general-appears-to-call-trump-wannabe-dictator',414,3,77,'Retiring as chair of the US joint chiefs of staff, the army general Mark Milley directed a parting shot at Donald Trump, the president he served but whom he seemed to call a “wannabe dictator”.

In addition, more workers than ever have health conditions that limit their ability to do their job: <a href=\"https://www.health.org.uk/publications/long-reads/what-we-know-about-the-uk-s-working-age-health-challenge\" title=\"\">3.7 million in total</a>. Almost one in five people aged between 16 and 64 now report having a work-limiting health issue. While rates are highest for older workers – 28% of those aged 55-64, compared with 15% of those aged 16-34 – poor health has risen most quickly in the youngest groups; someone aged 16-34 is twice as likely to have such a problem as they were a decade ago. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The gap in life expectancy for the most and least affluent has increased in recent years</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Britain cannot fix its growth problem without reducing the number of people who have left the labour market altogether because of ill health. This is also key to tackling not just health inequalities – the gap in life expectancy for the most and least affluent has increased in <a href=\"https://www.health.org.uk/sites/default/files/2020-03/Health%20Equity%20in%20England_The%20Marmot%20Review%2010%20Years%20On_executive%20summary_web.pdf\" title=\"\">recent years</a> – but also to reducing the UK’s gaping economic inequalities between the regions; the more deprived an area, the higher rate of working-age ill health it is <a href=\"https://www.health.org.uk/publications/long-reads/what-we-know-about-the-uk-s-working-age-health-challenge\" title=\"\">likely to have</a>. The growing numbers of younger people with long-term health conditions, including mental health concerns, who have many years of their working lives left, suggests that if this issue goes unaddressed, the problem will get worse.</p> <p>Improving working-age ill health must be an urgent priority. This is partly about addressing the parlous state of the NHS: the UK does not spend nearly enough on healthcare per head compared with other affluent, <a href=\"https://www.health.org.uk/about-the-health-foundation/get-involved/events/health-is-wealth\" title=\"\">ageing societies</a>. Waiting lists for treatment are at <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7281/\" title=\"\">record highs</a>, with knock-on impact for people’s ability to work, and the longer people are out of work because of poor health, the more difficult it is for them to re-enter the labour market. Demand for the NHS cannot be reduced without spending more on social care for older people; a lack of care in the community means patients who do not need to be on hospital wards are spending too long there because of a lack of other options. Mental health services are in a particularly bad state; young people with such needs are having to wait months, sometimes even years to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/apr/16/buckling-nhs-fails-to-treat-250000-children-with-mental-health-problems\" title=\"\">access clinical care after a GP referral</a>. More funding for <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/122-million-employment-boost-for-people-receiving-mental-health-support\" title=\"\">talking therapies</a> is welcome, but only a modest start.</p> <p>Yet fixing the NHS is nowhere near enough. Employers need to be encouraged to provide more support for employees who are struggling with their health to help them stay in work. And the UK’s higher than average <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/files/2023-04/1682577258_healthy-people-prosperous-lives-april-2023.pdf\" title=\"\">preventable mortality rate</a> – deaths that could be avoided through treatment – is not just a matter of improving levels of acute care. Covid affected the UK more as a result of a poorer public health baseline, including internationally high levels of obesity and related conditions such as diabetes, blood pressure and cardiac conditions. Reducing the incidence of long-term health conditions among the working-age population also requires a sustained focus on improving the nation’s health through diet and exercise.</p> <p>The prize for any government that achieves this is immense: a happier, healthier workforce, and a wealthier country with better public infrastructure and a more generous safety net. There is a self-reinforcing positive dynamic at play here: spend more on the services that improve health and wellbeing and there are rewards to be reaped. Yet both the Conservatives and Labour have committed themselves to ferociously tough spending plans for the next parliament. Labour has said that, if it wins the next election, its route to spending more will be through higher growth. But what if higher growth cannot be achieved without lifting workers out of poverty and improving their access to healthcare first? That is the unenviable conundrum the next government will face.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In the same way therapy speak has become part of the daily lexicon, is it reductive to those who have a genuine anxiety disorder? </p> <p>Tang argues that while slogan clothing may encourage conversation, it may still not leave wearers equipped with the ability to handle deeper conversation around it. She also sees problems with defining oneself via one’s mental wellbeing. “A mental health issue is a diagnosis and series of symptoms,” Tang says. “It is not your identity.” </p> <p>Tang also notes concerns with people wearing mental health merchandise for “secondary gains”, saying: “The primary gain of disclosing a medical condition or illness is for treatment. The secondary gain is the attention that comes from it. It’s the ‘Are you OK?’ from strangers.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"272dcbf54d181cc7bc846a13df419c5f6f878246\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/272dcbf54d181cc7bc846a13df419c5f6f878246/0_66_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Self Care Is For Everyone.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Self Care Is For Everyone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR IMAGE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fashion and mental health have a problematic past. In 2001, Alexander McQueen set his show in a space that seemed to mimic a padded cell. (Vogue <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2001-ready-to-wear/alexander-mcqueen\">described it as</a>: “Demented girls, wearing hospital headbands and everything from extraordinary mussel-shell skirts to impossibly chic pearl-coloured cocktail dresses, slithered and strutted while uselessly attempting to fly over the cuckoo’s nest.”) Six years later, Vogue Italia featured a shoot by Steven Meisel entitled “Super Mods Enter Rehab”, which included the model Lara Stone being dragged by nurses down a hospital corridor and locked up in cells.</p> <p>In 2019, the Gucci show opened with a series of models walking on a conveyor belt wearing what appeared to be a fashion take on straitjackets. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/22/gucci-model-mental-health-protest-milan-fashion-week\">In an unplanned protest</a>, one of the models, Ayesha Tan-Jones, held up their hands, on which they had scrawled the words “mental health is not fashion”. Afterwards, they posted a statement to Instagram: “Presenting these struggles as props for selling clothes in today’s capitalist climate is vulgar, unimaginative and offensive to the millions of people around the world affected by these issues.”</p> <p>So, is the commodification of mental health reductive? Russell says she wouldn’t be “terribly surprised” if customers were buying medical themed merchandise without actually experiencing the conditions. “But,” she says, “no one is going to go to their doctor and say: ‘I want this medication because I saw it on a T-shirt’.”</p> <p><em>To read the complete version of this newsletter – complete with this week’s trending topics in The Measure and your wardrobe dilemmas solved – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-fashion-statement-newsletter-our-free-fashion-email\">subscribe to receive Fashion Statement</a> in your inbox every Thursday.</em></p>','2023-11-10 07:30:04',1,'2023-12-26 01:44:32','2023-12-26 01:44:32'),(598,'Government inaction on obesity is harming our health | Letters','government-inaction-on-obesity-is-harming-our-health-letters',392,4,78,'Re your report on the cost of people being overweight in the UK, (Cost of people being overweight in UK now £98bn, study finds, 4 December), while it is important that we do not shy away from the worrying health impact of being overweight and obese in the UK, it’s vital that we focus on where the real power to make change actually lies – with the government and with industry.

It is not making decisions about you based on a population that might be completely unrepresentative. It is genuinely personalised.”</p> <p>The current state of the art model can be found in cardiology. Already, companies are using patient-specific heart models to help design medical devices, while the Barcelona-based start-up <a href=\"https://elem.bio/elem-technology.html\">ELEM BioTech</a> is offering companies the ability to test drugs and devices on simulated models of human hearts.</p> <p>“We have already run a number of virtual human trials on several compounds and are about to enter into a new phase, with our product being ready and deployed in the cloud for external access by pharmaceutical clients,” said the ELEM co-founder and chief executive, Chris Morton.</p> <p>Speaking at the <a href=\"https://www.rsm.ac.uk/events/digital-health/2023-24/tes01/\">Digital Twins conference </a>at the Royal Society of Medicine in London on Friday, Dr Caroline Roney, of Queen Mary University of London, described efforts to develop personalised heart models that would help surgeons plan surgery for patients with irregular and chaotic heartbeats (atrial fibrillation).</p> <p>“Often surgeons will use an approach that works on average, but making patient-specific predictions and ensuing that they predict longer-term outcomes is really challenging,” Roney said. “I think there are many applications in cardiovascular disease where we will see this sort of approach coming through, such as deciding what type of valve to use, or where to insert it during heart valve replacement.”</p> <p>Cancer patients are also expected to benefit. Artificial intelligence experts at the drug company GSK are working with cancer researchers at King’s College London to build <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/17/gsk-teams-with-kings-college-to-use-ai-to-fight-cancer\">digital replicas of patients’ tumours </a>by using images and genetic and molecular data, as well as growing patients’ cancer cells in 3D and testing how they respond to drugs.</p> <p>By applying machine learning to this data, scientists can predict how individual patients are likely to respond to different drugs, combinations of drugs, and dosing regimens.</p> <p>“You can’t do this repetitively with the real patient with multiple drugs and drug combinations, because every time you try a new treatment it is a clinical trial,” said Prof Tony Ng, of King’s.</p> <p>“We are trying to find a solution while the patient is still alive, so if they come back with a recurrence [of their cancer] we will know how to treat them, or which clinical trial to put them on.”</p> <p>Proof of concept trials are expected to begin next year.</p> <p>Researchers are even developing digital twins for pregnancy, which could help develop drugs for conditions such as placental insufficiency or pre-eclampsia, and a better understanding of the physiological processes underpinning pregnancy and labour.</p> <p>“You can’t do experiments on pregnant women in many cases, and there are also not good animal models for human pregnancy,” said Prof Michelle Oyen, the director of the Center for Women’s Health Engineering at Washington University in St Louis.</p> <p>Oyen is building placenta models from ultrasound scans taken during pregnancy and high-resolution images after birth in women with healthy and complicated pregnancies, and training an algorithm to recognise and construct a digital replica of the various tissues.</p> <p>“Our goal is to try to figure out things that we could measure on a live person to predict who is likely to have problems with placental function during pregnancy, and intervene to prevent things like stillbirth,” Oyen said.</p> <p>Her collaborator, Prof Kristin Myers, of Columbia University in New York, is constructing models of the cervix, uterus and the membranes that surround the foetus. Their long-term goal is to combine them all into a single model of an individual that could predict how the pregnancy might play out.</p> <p>Myers said: “My hope is that we could take a simplistic ultrasonic scan of maternal anatomy and be able to assess how this uterus is going to grow and stretch, and better time when labour is going to happen.” It might even predict a long or complicated labour, and help women make a more informed decision about whether to have a caesarean section, she said.</p> <p>Other researchers are building a digital twins of hospitals to try to improve the efficiency with which individual patients move through the healthcare system.</p> <p>“By tracking digital signatures that are made every time anything happens with a patient – from when an X-ray is ordered, performed and reported, to when that patient is booked for an outpatient appointment and attends it – we can build a highly detailed, real-time picture of how patients with similar conditions move through the system,” said Dr Jacob Koris, a trauma and orthopaedic surgeon and digital lead at <a href=\"https://gettingitrightfirsttime.co.uk/\">Getting It Right First Time</a>, a national programme designed to improve the treatment and care of patients.</p> <p>“Doing so could identify areas we need to improve, but also good practice that improves patient care, which we can use to redesign how we look after patients.”</p>','2023-11-12 05:22:25',1,'2023-12-26 01:44:34','2023-12-26 01:44:34'),(600,'Climate action must focus on women’s health | Letter','climate-action-must-focus-on-womens-health-letter',392,4,78,'I was pleased to read your piece shining a light on the intersection of the climate crisis and its impact on sexual and reproductive health and rights (Climate crisis is ‘not gender neutral’: UN calls for more policy focus on women, 10 October).

It was criticised by epidemiologists and others at the time. One of the issues raised at the time was that the scheme would disproportionately force back into work people from minority ethnic communities who had higher rates of Covid mortality. If these staff were on furlough, the return to work may not have benefited them, either from an economic or medical standpoint.</p> <p>A much better use of the money spent on “Eat out to help out” would have been to install filtration systems in schools during the first lockdown to enable them to reopen sooner. If schools had been able to fully open sooner, the damage to the economy and educational outcomes would have been less. <br><strong>Angelique Fairbrass</strong><br><em>Prenton, Merseyside</em></p> <p>• Larry Elliott says that that lockdowns were “untried and untested” before Italy implemented one in March 2020. In fact, lockdowns and quarantine have been used for centuries. A striking example would be the outcomes of the 1918 influenza pandemic that killed roughly a quarter of inhabitants in Western Samoa, the highest rate recorded. Despite the close cultural links with the New Zealand-governed colony, American Samoa successfully excluded the infection for years. It was the largest known state to avoid any deaths from the pandemic. This was due to Commandant John Poyer, who <a href=\"https://ndhadeliver.natlib.govt.nz/delivery/DeliveryManagerServlet?dps_pid=FL18583886\">ordered quarantine</a> against all traffic from outside the colony in October 1918.</p> <p>The UK’s Covid outcomes are entwined with the issue of <a href=\"https://www.instituteofhealthequity.org/resources-reports/fair-society-healthy-lives-the-marmot-review/fair-society-healthy-lives-full-report-pdf.pdf\">longstanding social and economic disadvantage and disparity</a>.

By recognising the most common errors, we can instantly improve our choices to ensure that we bring maximum satisfaction to the people we love.</p> <h2>Think beyond the moment</h2> <p>Many of our mistakes arise from a kind of myopia. The person giving the gift is fixated on the single moment of the exchange – they want a gift that will elicit the biggest immediate reaction, even if the pleasure is short-lived. Receivers, however, tend to feel greater gratitude for presents that bring longer-term enjoyment.</p> <p>“There is a natural perspective gap,” says Prof Adelle Yang at the National University of Singapore. She calls this the “<a href=\"https://home.uchicago.edu/~ourminsky/Smile%20Seeking.pdf\">smile-seeking hypothesis</a>” and has found strong evidence for the idea with a series of surveys. Consider Valentine’s Day gifts. She has found that givers will prefer to buy a bouquet of blooming flowers, for example, which might look stunning at the time of exchange but will soon lose their petals, whereas receivers prefer a house plant they can tend for weeks after.</p> <p>If you are worried that you are falling for this bias, you could ask yourself whether you would make the same choice if you were to send the gift by post. Yang has found that people tend to make the better decision when they know that they will not be physically present at the opening, and so will not be able to witness the immediate reaction of the person receiving the gift.</p> <p>Our focus on the moment of exchange can be responsible for many other howlers. People tend to prefer to go off-piste rather than buy a present that is already on someone’s wishlist, for instance. Givers want to see the surprise as they open the gift, but receivers prefer getting the presents they had actually requested.</p> <p>“Surprising presents are doubly problematic,” says Prof Jeffrey Galak, who studies the psychology of gift-giving at Carnegie Mellon University. “Not only do you get the wrong thing, but if you’re close friends or romantic partners, you can’t do anything about it.” It would seem incredibly ungrateful to ask for a refund, after all. As our cluttered homes testify, the unwanted gifts of Christmas past can haunt us for many months or years after the event.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d974cadcb756a94676992e8744c5dd11ea4396e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d974cadcb756a94676992e8744c5dd11ea4396e/0_207_5665_3399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A person\'s hands passing a present to another\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cost has little link to how much a gift is welcomed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dulin/Getty Images/RooM RF</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Consider experiences over tangible goods</h2> <p>The smile-seeking hypothesis can also explain why we prefer to buy material gifts: a fancy new watch or necklace compared with concert tickets or a cooking lesson, for example. The giver is excited to have something large and shiny to hand over, but the new and exciting experiences tend to bring greater overall happiness, and memories of the event will linger long after the material gifts have lost their lustre. “If you are optimising your choices for the exchange, you want to give the sparkliest thing that you can deliver,” says Galak. “But that’s doing the receiver a disservice.”</p> <h2>Forget the price tag</h2> <p>For many people, gift-giving is all about the price tag. We pay as much as we can afford in the belief that the cost reflects our esteem for the person. The psychological research, however, suggests that we vastly overestimate the importance of monetary value. “All the evidence points to the fact that cost has little relationship with how well a gift is received,” says Galak. Additionally, we are more likely to flash the cash with people who are already wealthy than poorer people who may be in greater need of a little luxury.</p> <p>The potential for social comparison only increases our preoccupation with price. We worry that someone else’s showy largesse will cast a shadow over our efforts; Galak and Givi’s <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.10.009\">research</a> suggests that some people will opt out of the gift-giving altogether if they believe that they cannot keep up with the “competition”. In reality, the relative value of people’s presents makes very little difference to the way that they are perceived; each present tends to be considered on its own merits. “[Our fears] don’t play out on the recipient’s side,” says Galak. “They’re just happy to get a gift.”</p> <h2>Override your egotism</h2> <p>In some situations, we may even be influenced by feelings of envy towards the recipients themselves. Imagine that your sister has asked for some new sunglasses for Christmas. You find a stylish pair that you know she will love, but they will make your own shades look unfashionable by comparison. In such situations, people will frequently choose to pick a lower-quality gift: they would rather risk disappointing the recipient than trigger jealous feelings in themselves.</p> <p>Our desire to feel unique can also be a barrier. You may know that your friend hankers after a piece of Beatles memorabilia that you own, for instance, when you happen to find the same item in an online marketplace. It would make the perfect present, but you want to remain the only person you know who owns this coveted object. If you buy it for the other person, you will no longer feel so special. As a result, you choose a completely different present – one that would not generate nearly so much gratitude.</p> <p>“We think of gift-giving as an act of altruism, but these self-serving motivations can come into play,” says Givi. And by overriding that egotism, we can make much better choices.</p> <h2>Overcome your fear of sentimentality</h2> <p>If you feel sufficiently close to someone, you may opt for something of sentimental value, such as a photo or scrapbook celebrating your relationship. This can feel a little exposing. When considering sentimental gifts, people often worry that their friend or partner would prefer to receive something with a higher price tag and greater practical use. But Givi and Galak’s research shows that those assumptions are wrong; people would rather receive the item with greater emotional resonance.</p> <p>If you feel nervous about making this choice yourself, be reassured that Givi practises what he preaches. “Pretty much every time you give a sentimental gift, it ends up being a home run,” he says. “It really, really makes people happy.”</p> <p>• David Robson is the author of <em>The </em><em>Expectation Effect: How Your Mindset Can Transform Your Life</em>, published by Canongate (£10.99).<em> </em>To support the <em>Guardian</em> and <em>Observer</em> order your copy at <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-expectation-effect-9781838853303\">guardianbookshop.com</a>.

It was the year in which artificial intelligence (AI) finally went mainstream. I’m referring, of course, to ChatGPT and its stablemates – large language models. Released late in 2022, ChatGPT went viral in 2023, dazzling users with its fluency and seemingly encyclopaedic knowledge. The tech industry – led by trillion-dollar companies – was wrong-footed by the success of a product from a company with just a few hundred employees. As I write, there is desperate jostling to take the lead in the new “generative AI” marketplace heralded by ChatGPT.</p> <p>Why did ChatGPT take off so spectacularly? First, it is very accessible. Anyone with a web browser can access the most sophisticated AI on the planet. And second, it finally feels like the AI we were promised – it wouldn’t be out of place in a movie, and it’s a lot more fluent than the <em>Star Trek</em> computer. We’ve been using AI for a long time without realising it, but finally, we have something that looks like the real deal.

Well, in 1940, Elisha Loomis’s classic book <em>The Pythagorean Proposition</em> had a section entitled “Why No Trigonometric, Analytic Geometry Nor Calculus Proof Possible”. Hence, <em>a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup></em> can’t be proved using <em>sin2</em>(θ)+<em>cos2</em>(θ)=<em>1</em>.</p> <p>This is because these two equations have a circular relationship. For example: If A is true if B is true and B is true if A is true, then how do we know that A and B are actually true?</p> <p>Johnson and Jackson aren’t the first to derive a trigonometry proof for Pythagoras’s theorem. However, their “waffle cone” proof using the sine rule and infinite geometric series showed great creativity and mathematical agility. There are limitations to their approach – it is not valid when ∅=π/4 (45 degrees), for example. But that is fixable.</p> <p>Last year, Katharine Birbalsingh, the former social mobility adviser to the UK government, was criticised for saying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/27/girls-shun-physics-a-level-as-they-dislike-hard-maths-says-social-mobility-head\">girls are less likely to choose physics A-level</a> because it involves “hard maths”. Johnson and Jackson’s achievement spoke eloquently to the contrary. <strong>Nira Chamberlain</strong></p> <p><em>Nira Chamberlain OBE is president of the Mathematical Association and a visiting professor at Loughborough University</em></p> <h2>4.

The rest of the world was peopled when a few left that pan-African cradle within the past 100,000 years. Until recently, this was largely known from the old bones of the long dead. But recovering DNA from those old bones has become fruitful. In October, a study led by Sarah Tishkoff at the University of Pennsylvania showed that the small amount of Neanderthal DNA in living Africans today had entered the <em>Homo sapiens</em> lineage as early as 250,000 years ago somewhere in Eurasia, meaning that we had left Africa several times, and way earlier than thought.</p> <p>How were these revelations uncovered? By doing something that has been paradoxically overlooked in our studies of our African origins: actually looking at the genomes of African people.</p> <p>It may seem small, and incremental, but the more we look – especially among people and areas until now vastly under-represented – the more we are going to find about our own story. <strong>Adam Rutherford</strong></p> <p><em>Adam Rutherford is a writer, broadcaster and lecturer in genetics at University College London</em><em>.

The slow-boiled one doesn’t notice until the temperature reaches lethal levels. 2023 will be the hottest year on record. That record was previously set seven years ago, in 2016. As King Charles said at Cop28, we are becoming immune to what the records are telling us.</p> <p>The impacts of the heat are mounting. Warmer seas and a warmer atmosphere contributed to events that brought death and destruction at an alarming rate. In Libya, more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/25/libya-floods-officials-detained-derna\">10,000 people died when a flood swept a city into the sea</a>. Fires burned through Greek islands and Canadian forests. Tropical Cyclone Freddy battered communities in east Africa already pummelled by poverty. Drought and heat made some regions uninhabitable.</p> <p>The good news is, the answers already exist. In the past year, the UK produced more green energy than ever before. AI forecasts began doing work a million human forecasters couldn’t manage, analysing weather and climate data at an unprecedented rate. The Nasa Swot satellite started measuring where all the water is on Earth, helping to prevent future disasters.</p> <p>Humans think they are smarter than frogs, but we’ll only save ourselves if we realise that we are the frogs, the source of the heat, and the experimenting psychopaths. <strong>Hannah Cloke</strong></p> <p><em>Hannah </em><em>Cloke OBE is a professor of hydrology at the University of Reading</em></p> <h2>6.

For some, this has reduced trust in health sciences and services, including preventive measures such as vaccines. So it is cause for celebration that the UK is trailblazing a biotechnology therapy for sickle cell disease and beta thalassaemia. These debilitating and sometimes deadly diseases are respectively more likely to afflict black populations and those with roots in the southern Mediterranean, Middle East, south Asia, and Africa. In a world-first, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/mhra-authorises-world-first-gene-therapy-that-aims-to-cure-sickle-cell-disease-and-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia\">the UK medicines regulator </a>has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/nov/16/uk-medicines-regulator-approves-casgevy-gene-therapy-for-two-blood-disorders-sickle-cell\">approved the Crispr–Cas9 genome-editing tool</a> called Casgevy, for the treatment of disease. The therapy has been shown to relieve debilitating episodes of pain in sickle cell disease and to remove or reduce the need for red-blood cell transfusions in thalassaemia for at least a year.</p> <p>While heartening, it remains to be seen how the potential risks play out. Will the positive outcomes continue in the long term? What of the safety implications? There is, for example, the possibility that Crispr–Cas9 can sometimes make unintended genetic modifications with unknown effect. Equally, this therapy may cost as much as <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03590-6\">$2m (£1.6m) per person</a>. In setting budgets, will these diseases continue to be a focus?</p> <p>Yet the approval gives cause for cautious optimism – not least because including groups frequently overlooked could mark a small, but important, shift towards making healthcare more equitable. <strong>Ann Phoenix</strong></p> <p><em>Ann Phoenix is a professor of psychosocial studies at the UCL Institute of Education</em></p> <h2>7.

On the other hand, 735 million people worldwide are starving. However, more people die from being obese than from being undernourished. So the discovery of a group of drugs known as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor stimulants is welcome. These GLP-1 drugs were originally licensed to control diabetes and they have since been licensed as weight-loss medicines. Wegovy, the poster child of these medicines, works by reducing blood glucose and by making people feel full more quickly when eating. In a two-year, 304-person clinical trial, subjects on Wegovy lost 15% of their body weight, while control subjects lost only 3%. Excitingly, this year we have also learned, from a large, three-year study involving heart disease patients, that Wegovy also reduces the risk of strokes, heart attacks and death from heart disease. It may seem as if we can now eat as much as we wish and get an injection for that, but there are side-effects to taking Wegovy, such as nausea, vomiting, headaches, tiredness and a possible risk of developing some thyroid cancers. Additionally, we still need to find a way to feed the starving. <strong>Ijeoma F Uchegbu</strong></p> <p><em>Ijeoma F Uchegbu is a professor of pharmaceutical nanoscience at University College London</em></p> <h2>8.

This led to a buzz of excitement and scepticism as labs worldwide rushed to try to replicate the findings, with LK-99 even trending on Twitter (now known as X).</p> <p>By late August, leading labs had failed to replicate the results. The current consensus is that there is not enough evidence of the crucial signatures of room temperature superconductivity.</p> <p>What does this story teach us? It shows that careful materials characterisation is essential before rushing to hyped conclusions, and that scientific peer review can be constructive and thrilling. Even if LK-99 isn’t the holy grail, it shouldn’t deter the search for a real room-temperature superconductor, and may open up unexpected pathways for exciting new research. <strong>Saiful Islam</strong></p> <p><em>Saiful Islam is a professor of materials science at Oxford University</em></p> <h2>9.

Thus far it was believed that the main reasons were habitat loss and pollution. But a <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2216573120\">research team led by Stanislas Rigal</a> investigated data on 170 bird species across 20,000 sites in 28 countries – including records collected by citizen scientists – and concluded that the principal bird killer is agricultural intensification. More precisely, it is an increased use of pesticides and fertilisers, which not only deprive birds of food, but also directly affect their health.</p> <p>Such large-scale studies are crucial for influencing decision-making and policy priorities.

These prompted considerable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jun/14/synthetic-human-embryos-created-in-groundbreaking-advance\">media coverage</a>, including front-page stories in some newspapers. The science was certainly newsworthy – the experiments reveal a remarkable ability of the stem cells to differentiate into the relevant tissues that self-organise into the appropriate pattern. However, some rather robust competition between several of the groups involved may have also contributed to the media interest.</p> <p>It is hoped that stem cell-based embryo models will provide a practical and “more ethical” alternative to working with normal embryos. Scientists may be able to learn much about how we develop and what goes wrong with congenital disease, miscarriage, and with assisted reproduction (IVF) that often fails – and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jul/01/are-human-embryo-models-a-cause-for-hope-or-alarm\">perhaps to find solutions</a> to these problems.</p> <p>What is clear at the moment, however, is that even the best of the models are not equivalent to normal human embryos, and the most rigorous test – to ask if they could be implanted into a womb – is something that everyone agrees should not be attempted. At the moment the vast majority, perhaps 99%, of the aggregates that are put into culture fail to give anything that resembles a human embryo. The efficiency needs to be improved if these models are going to find a use. <strong>Robin Lovell-Badge</strong></p> <p><em>Robin Lovell-Badge is a senior group leader and head of the Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology and Developmental Genetics at the Francis Crick Institute</em></p>','2023-12-23 11:00:29',1,'2023-12-26 01:44:44','2023-12-26 01:44:44'),(607,'The best recent science fiction, fantasy and horror – reviews roundup','the-best-recent-science-fiction-fantasy-and-horror-reviews-roundup',423,5,78,'The Reformatory by Tananarive Due (Titan, £9.99) Set in 1950 in segregated Florida, and inspired, like Colson Whitehead’s The Nickel Boys, by the violent abuse and deaths of Black children sent to the Dozier school for boys, this could have made for an unbearably grim read.

The story is, in one sense, familiar: the childhood and ministry of Jesus – here “Yeshu”, born a girl called Avigayil but identifying from an early age as male (Ryman uses Aramaic names rather than the more familiar biblical ones for greater historical verisimilitude). The novel’s God presides over a multiverse, and into each proliferating reality he sends a slightly different iteration of redemption. This grand science-fictional conceit is grounded by Ryman’s superbly precise and evocative writing, his immersively believable world. The relationship between Yeshu and his mother Maryam is beautifully rendered and the ending, though it can’t be unfamiliar, is intensely moving. Ryman’s gospel achieves what SF does at its best: beautifully estranging our too-familiar world, and making us think and feel anew.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"271697ea0ac0d1c9a4dda93ee5503b90036e480e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/271697ea0ac0d1c9a4dda93ee5503b90036e480e/0_0_500_769/325.jpg\" alt=\"Some Desperate Glory by Emily Tesh\" width=\"325\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/some-desperate-glory-9780356521831\" title=\"\">Some Desperate Glory</a><br></strong><em>Emily Tesh (Orbit</em><em>)</em><br>This sparky debut is a blend of space opera and military SF that refreshes both modes. Desperate Glory moves briskly, page-turningly, and provides all the satisfactions of widescreen galactic worldbuilding and adventure as it goes; but it never sacrifices complexity or trades in easy answers. Humanity is one of three galactic species to have independently discovered the “shadowspace” tech that powers starships, but we are regarded by the others as uncontrollably violent, having evolved “as apex predators in a hazardous biosphere” – the Earth. Now Earth has been destroyed, and the novel’s protagonist, Kyr, a genetically enhanced supersoldier, grows up in the military space station Gaea, unthinkingly embodying Gaea’s militaristic, fascistic ethos, focused on revenge. But as the story proceeds and she learns more about the universe, questioning her own assumptions, a richer, more complex sense of the nature of things grows in her. Kyr’s coming-of-age journey does not take the path plot-cliche leads you to expect, and the telling is bracingly twisty. An instant classic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"346c4aac961088d71a8630a06b89d9987ca46146\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/346c4aac961088d71a8630a06b89d9987ca46146/0_0_1748_2480/705.jpg\" alt=\"In Ascension by Martin MacInnes\" width=\"705\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/in-ascension-9781838956240\" title=\"\">In Ascension</a></strong><strong><br></strong><em>Martin MacInnes</em><em> (Atlantic)</em><br>Longlisted for the Booker, MacInnes’s novel is both spacious and intimate. Two sisters take different paths through life: outgoing Leigh becomes a marine biologist and travels the world; quieter, smaller Helena stays home with their mother and becomes a financial lawyer. Leigh is part of a survey-ship team that discovers an impossibly deep fissure in the ocean bed. Later, she joins a space mission to investigate an anomalous object passing through the solar system: a kilometres-long, spirally decorated traveller from deep space. This object eludes the mission as they chase after it through the solar system, but something happens to the consciousnesses of the crew. What Leigh sees in outer space are “the planets, the sun, the moons as a single curved body drifting through space like the juvenile stage of an aquatic life form”. It’s a novel about big, complex ideas – our place in the cosmos, our interconnectedness with one another and with the natural world – that is also brilliantly readable, wide-ranging and thrilling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"59afd3314bdc6fe9ce5f7d6788591907d68c9b81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59afd3314bdc6fe9ce5f7d6788591907d68c9b81/0_0_1600_2477/646.jpg\" alt=\"The Circumference of the World by Lavie Tidhar\" width=\"646\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-circumference-of-the-world-9781616963620\" title=\"\">The Circumference of the World</a><br></strong><em>Lavie Tidhar (Tachyon</em><em>)</em><br>Tidhar has recently intimated that he wants to leave SF and fantasy behind him (“I want a Booker,” he announced in the author’s note to his historical epic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/aug/13/maror-by-lavie-tidhar-review-violence-and-corruption-in-israels-underbelly\" title=\"\">Maror</a>, “and they don’t give you one of those for a book about elves”). But I don’t believe it: Tidhar’s imagination is so saturated in, and attuned to, the excellences of SF/fantasy that I don’t think he could abandon it even if he tried. The Circumference of the World is a case in point, a book that is not only SF but is about SF – about the golden age of Heinlein and Van Vogt, and the fantastical output of L Ron Hubbard, here fictionalised as Eugene Charles Hartley, pulp writer and founder of “the Church of the All-Seeing Eyes”. In a complex, expertly orchestrated set of nesting storylines, various characters search for Hartley’s schlocky novel Lode Stars, which may or may not explain the nature of the universe, but which appears to vanish as it is read. Detective noir rubs shoulders with epistolary fiction, a prison story and expertly pastiched pulp SF. Inventive, thought-provoking, audacious and, as ever with Tidhar, superbly readable, this is where his genius lies.<br><br>• To browse all science fiction and fantasy books included in the Guardian and Observer’s best books of 2023 visit <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/featured-in-the-guardian/books-of-the-year-2023/science-fiction-fantasy-and-horror/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">guardianbookshop.com</a>.

He said: “This should not be the occasion for a fanfare: England’s schools have been sold short by their government for more than a decade.”</p> <p>Wales struggled at the bottom of the domestic table with a 21-point drop in its maths score since 2018, while Scotland’s went down by 18 points – roughly equivalent to the loss of a year’s learning, the OECD said.</p> <p>“The last years haven’t been so great in Scotland,” said Andreas Schleicher, director for education and skills at the OECD. The results follow warnings from the Institute for Fiscal Studies last month that Scotland had experienced the largest historic decline in maths performance of the UK nations; it had been the best-performing in 2006.</p> <p>The Pisa data showed Scotland was now the third-best in the UK behind England and Northern Ireland on maths, with a mean score of 471, leaving it 55th out of 81 countries. Scotland’s decline was also larger than the OECD average of 16 points.</p> <p>The OECD figures also raised significant questions about the Scottish government’s attempts to narrow the attainment gap between poor and better-off pupils. It showed that gap was at its greatest in Scotland, at 16 points, compared with 10 for England, 12 for Northern Ireland and 10 for Wales.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/12/pisa_uk_oecd/giv-134255J5rDug3wE18/\" data-alt=\"2022 PISA scores have recorded some of the lowest levels\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/12/pisa_uk_oecd/giv-134255J5rDug3wE18/\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Jenny Gilruth, the Scottish education secretary, said Scotland’s performance on reading was stronger, placing it second in the UK, but the overall findings provided the Scottish government and councils with “key learning” on the need for action.</p> <p>“As is well understood, the Covid-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on our young people and their experience of learning and teaching,” she said.</p> <p>The Labour-led Welsh government said the pandemic had “derailed” progress it had been making in literacy and numeracy as it failed by a large margin to hit the Pisa targets it had set itself.</p> <p>In maths, Wales’s mean score for 2022 was 466 after registering the largest drop in the four nations over the four years. In reading its mean score was also 466 (against 483 in 2018) and in science 473 (488 in 2018), again the worst of the four nations in both.</p> <p>The Welsh education minister, Jeremy Miles, said: “Before the pandemic, we saw a strong improvement in literacy and numeracy standards in Wales. Sadly, it is clear that the pandemic has derailed some of this improvement.”</p> <p>As with previous Pisa cycles, the highest-performing education systems were in east Asia, with Singapore outperforming all other education systems in all subjects. Japan, Taiwan, Macau and South Korea were also near the top of the tables in all three subject areas, with Estonia the standout success in Europe once again.</p> <p>The OECD said there had been an “unprecedented” drop in attainment globally, with mean performance in OECD countries down 11 points in reading and almost 16 in maths – equivalent to three-quarters of a year’s worth of learning.</p> <p>Some countries managed to maintain and even improve their performance despite Covid, but Germany, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway and Poland had some of the most dramatic declines, with a drop of 25 score points or more in maths between 2018 and 2022.</p> <p>While the pandemic, which closed schools for months at a time in countries across the world and led to remote education, was the most obvious explanation for the decline in results, the OECD said students in countries such as Finland, Iceland, the Netherlands, the Slovak Republic and Sweden had scored lower marks for up to a decade or more.</p> <p>“This indicates that long-term issues in education systems are also to blame for the drop in performance. It is not just about Covid,” the OECD said.</p> <p>Natalie Perera, the chief executive of the Education Policy Institute (EPI), said: “Today’s Pisa results confirm that England, alongside many other OECD nations, has experienced considerable learning loss as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, England does remain above the OECD average in all subjects: maths, reading and science.”</p> <p>Perera also noted that the reported life satisfaction scores of UK students had fallen drastically between 2015 and 2022, to the extent that the UK now has the second-lowest average life satisfaction of 15-year-olds across all OECD countries.</p> <p>“The government must prioritise education and, in particular, address the urgent teacher recruitment and retention issues that the country is facing.

It’s a statistic that I don’t like, and I want us to change.”</p> <p>It’s just as bad in physics, where there are also no black professors – both officially and perhaps actually. Dr Richards (above right), who is one of the country’s leading physicists and <a href=\"https://theblackettlabfamily.com/\">co-founded a collective</a> to promote black people working in the field, says he can’t think of any black physics professors. “There are zero, unless there is one hiding in a maths department somewhere.”</p> <p>To put those numbers in context, there are, according to Hesa, a total of 520 chemistry professors, and 825 in physics. The situation is (a little) better in biosciences where there are five black professors among 1,345, and engineering, which has about 20 black professors out of 1,730. </p> <p>Among all the sciences, there are a total 70 black professors (0.6% of the total). Of those 70, just 10 are women. Black people make up 4.2% of the population in England and Wales, <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/ethnicity/bulletins/ethnicgroupenglandandwales/census2021#:~:text=In%20England%20the%20percentage%20of,was%203.0%25%20(1.7%20million)\">according to the latest census</a>.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Why aren’t there more black scientists?</strong></p> <p>“It’s complicated,” says Richards, whose work focuses on using light to find particles hidden in the atmosphere. “But, most of it, I think, comes from being from a minority group and not knowing what routes are open to you, or having anyone to advocate for you.</p> <p>“If you’re from a marginalised group, without networks, it is very easy to be put off even if you’re very good.” The statistics show that the proportion of black people in science drops at every step of the academic ladder, from GCSEs, to A Levels, to undergraduate degrees, postgrads, PhDs, postdoc researchers, and, finally, professors – the most senior academic grade.</p> <p>Richards, whose parents emigrated from Jamaica to the UK as part of the Windrush generation, says his interest in science can be traced back to when he was just two. “The rest of the family were downstairs, and suddenly there was a loud bang and they all ran upstairs to find me sitting in front of plug socket with a pair of scissors in my hands,” he says. “I’d clearly watched my mum plug something in and wanted to figure out how it worked.”</p> <p>That got Richards, who was mostly brought up in a single parent household, labelled a “bad child”. “But it was a product of my inquisitive mind,” he says. “I always wanted to know how things worked, that’s what got me into science.”</p> <p>He wasn’t particularly studious, until an incident at school. “I must have been about 13 or 14 and we were doing a chemistry test at school. I got the top mark in the class, and it was the first time I had ever got the top mark in any class.</p> <p>“Getting the top mark was a surprise to me, and also to the so-called ‘boffins’ who weren’t very pleased. One of them put up his hand and asked the teacher if they could re-mark my work.</p> <p>“The teacher shot that down pretty quickly, but they made it so I couldn’t enjoy that one sweet victory.”</p> <p>Richards doesn’t describe the incident as racist, preferring to call it “ignorance”, but says the school, a comprehensive, was “full of prejudices, even from the teachers who had decided pretty quickly which students would be academic and which would be more vocational”.</p> <p>It was that incident that spurred Richards on. “I don’t like unfairness, that’s what drives me,” he says. “I’m going to show you that people like me can achieve just as well as you can, if not better. And, it’s what you need in academia, you are always having to prove yourself in one way or another. You need what I call academic resilience.”</p> <p>Richards, who features in <a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/articles/2021/07/stormzy-childrens-book-superheroes-competition\">Stormzy’s children’s book on modern superheroes</a>, says he has always known there aren’t many black scientists, but it was looking at the data that confirmed it.</p> <p>“We looked at over 10 years worth of data, and the trends are stark – there is a huge attrition rate among black people,” he says. “As a scientist, if the data is worse than you were expecting, your first reaction is ‘maybe there is a problem with the method or the equipment’. But no, the stats are just really bad.”</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Tackling the problem</strong></p> <p>The Royal Society of Chemistry last year <a href=\"https://www.rsc.org/globalassets/22-new-perspectives/talent/racial-and-ethnic-inequalities-in-the-chemical-sciences/missing-elements-report.pdf\">published a report</a> – “Missing Elements” – that found racism is “pervasive” in the field. And warned that “exclusion and marginalisation are to a large extent normalised for many Black chemists and others from minority ethnic backgrounds”. It introduced a support scheme to increase the number of black researchers in chemistry</p> <p>The Royal Society, which is different and represent all sciences, has now gone further introducing a funding scheme to increase the number of black scientists at the very top of the academic pyramid.</p> <p>From November, black PhD students will be able to apply for <a href=\"https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/career-development-fellowship/\">five new career development fellowships</a> to “kickstart independent research careers” in science, technology, engineering or maths (STEM).</p> <p>Richards is hopeful for the future. “We do now have some black British students, and it is important that they can see people who look like them,” he says. “It is not uncommon to hear about people who have gone through their education without being taught by a single black teacher or lecturer.</p> <p>“It’s not a burden that weighs you down every day, but if you had one black lecturer or lab demonstrator it would give you some validation that, yes you do belong here.”</p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94e9bdb19016722f8cdc65524c14ee77e95d33d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94e9bdb19016722f8cdc65524c14ee77e95d33d3/0_448_3068_1841/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An illustration of older runners, showing life doesn’t have to slow down at 40.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An illustration of older runners, showing life doesn’t have to slow down at 40.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Mark Long/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Could your prime still be ahead of you at the age of 40?

After a few minutes of compressions, and one strike to the chest strongly reminiscent of David Harbour’s actions on the show, Piquette regained consciousness, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/19/florida-boy-saves-man-cpr-stranger-things\">and went on to make a full recovery</a>. “I was a little hesitant about him watching [Stranger Things],” Macmillan’s mother told the Guardian, citing the show’s science fiction-horror premise. “But I’m definitely glad that I let him.”</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/12/the-upside-sign-up-for-our-weekly-email\">Sign up here</a> for a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to you every Sunday</strong></p> <h2>Bored at work?</h2> <p>And finally, the Guardian’s puzzles are here to keep you entertained throughout the day – with plenty more on the Guardian’s Puzzles app for <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1487780661?mt=8\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.guardian.puzzles&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US\">Android</a>.

While some of our miscreants have inspired huge controversy, others have slipped under the rage radar; this list of wrongs is the place to put that right.</p> <h2><strong>Mostafa Asal</strong></h2> <p>This has been a classic year for the man they call, worryingly, Raging Bull, who at 20 reached the top of the world squash rankings for the first time. He couldn’t stay there, thanks in part to spending 18 weeks of the year suspended. The Egyptian was banned for six weeks in March and another dozen in August, both for dangerous play – he accused his opponents of diving – leading his father, Mahmoud, to allege a conspiracy “trying in every way to destroy the future of my son and prevent him from reaching the top”. (Mahmoud was banned from all Professional Squash Association events between January and November for his part in a violent courtside confrontation.) In January his semi-final opponent at the Houston Open, Marwan El Shorbagy, was carried off on a stretcher and then to hospital after an “accidental” clash, which looked to many observers like an elbow in the privates. “If this is the future of our sport then good luck,” said El Shorbagy. There has been a long-running feud with France’s Victor Crouin, the world No 11, who said the Egyptian shows “very poor sportsmanship and a lack of maturity” and “the need to create controversy on and off court”. But there’s hope for the future – this month Asal apologised for his antics. “I’m happy I’m changing for the good,” he said. We’ll see about that.</p> <h2><strong>Aram Nikolyan</strong></h2> <p>In April, the European Weightlifting Championships took place in Armenia, where the competing teams included neighbouring Azerbaijan. Thanks to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict relations between the two states are subarctic, but perhaps sport could be the great healer? When it came to repairing the cracked connection between these nations, could weightlifting do the, er, heavy lifting? We got the answer to that in the opening ceremony when a local fashion designer, working for the host broadcaster, snuck on to the stage, grabbed an Azerbaijani flag and set fire to it. “My only desire was to ensure that the flag of Azerbaijan does not fly in Yerevan,” he said. Nikolyan was arrested but swiftly released and the Azeri team withdrew from the tournament the following morning. Their ministry of sport raged that the “barbaric act” was “in complete contradiction with the noble goals and principles of sport, which promotes peace and mutual understanding between nations”, and their prosecutor general put out an international arrest warrant for Nikolyan. Armenia’s subsequent bid to host the 2024 world championships was unsuccessful.</p> <h2><strong>Luis Rubiales and Faruk Koca</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e75faa1940bf9508aa475f7c0a1a31eae5efd85\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e75faa1940bf9508aa475f7c0a1a31eae5efd85/0_29_2065_1239/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Referee Halil Meler holds his face after being punched by Faruk Koca\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Referee Halil Meler holds his face after being punched by Faruk Koca.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abdurrahman Antakyali/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The year’s great footballing miscreants and neither of them footballers. The former Spain FA chief makes the list for a kiss, the owner of the Turkish side Ankaragucu for a punch – the acts couldn’t be more different, but as a matter of policy it is best to get permission before attempting either.</p> <h2><strong>Joasia Zakrzewski</strong></h2> <p>It’s the classic long-distance-runner-gets-a-lift story, a tale as old as long-distance running. In the 1896 Olympic marathon Spyridon Belokas came third but was disqualified for travelling part of the course by carriage and it was in his footsteps that Zakrzewski travelled during the Manchester to Liverpool 50-mile race in April. She also finished third, collected her trophy and medal, and that would have been the end of the story had she not uploaded her race data on Strava, where users noticed that for 2.5 miles she went at improbable speeds, covering one mile in 100 seconds. Zakrzewski, who has a long and impressive record in distance running, said her judgment was clouded by jet lag, having just arrived in the country from Australia. “I was feeling unwell and spaced out and not thinking clearly,” she said. In other vehicle/athlete-interface news the Mexico City Marathon descended into farce after about 11,000 of the 30,000 participants were disqualified for using cars, bikes and public transport to skip sections of the course. This year set a new standard for the scandal-blighted event, which disqualified 5,806 runners in 2017 and 3,090 in 2018.</p> <h2><strong>Nasra Abukar Ali</strong></h2> <p>This is a messy one, a tangled web of favours and families. If there is one lesson to take from it let it be this: do not start your athletics career in the 100m competition at a major, televised event. Not under any circumstances. Not even if nobody else from your country wants the place. “In Somalia many women are scared of taking part in sporting activities,” Ali said. “When the 100m race failed to attract female participants, I volunteered to represent my country.” And off to the World University Games she went, where she ran the 100m in 21.81sec, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/02/slowest-ever-sprinter-somalia-nasra-abukar-ali\">nearly 10sec behind the winner of her heat</a> (22 women have run the 200m faster). As footage of her plodding performance went viral the head of Somalia’s athletics agency, Khadija Adan Dahir – or as Ali calls her, auntie – was sacked for “causing the country widespread embarrassment”. Most unfortunately, given that this was an event for students, Ali seems not to have learned her lesson: she says she stands ready “to represent my country when called upon in the future”.</p>','2023-12-17 03:00:21',1,'2023-12-26 01:44:56','2023-12-26 01:44:56'),(615,'Sports Illustrated accused of publishing articles written by AI','sports-illustrated-accused-of-publishing-articles-written-by-ai',430,6,77,'The US sports publication Sports Illustrated is embroiled in scandal after it has been accused of running articles written by artificial intelligence.

But, like in Sora Tanaka’s case, no Drew Ortiz exists – his biography and headshot were apparently made up by AI, Futurism found.</p> <p>The Ortiz article in question contained copy that said: “Volleyball is one of the most popular sports in the world, and for good reason. It’s fast-paced, has a high skill ceiling, and is generally an exciting sport to both play and watch. Even people who don’t watch sports can easily understand the intensity and skill required to play volleyball whenever they watch clips. There’s a reason why it’s been such a mainstay in modern sports to this day.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Arena Group wrote in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sinow/status/1729275460922622374?s=46&amp;t=dlpx88UvGvCPTofxCocUsQ\">statement</a>: “Today, an article was published alleging that Sports Illustrated published AI-generated articles. According to our initial investigation, this is not accurate.</p> <p>“A number of AdVon’s e-commerce articles ran on certain Arena websites. We continually monitor our partners and were in the midst of a review when these allegations were raised. AdVon has assured us that all of the articles in question were written and edited by humans.”</p> <p>The Arena Group announced that it cut ties with AdVon and removed its content from Arena websites. The Arena Group also said it does not condone the practice of writing under pseudonyms.</p> <p>The controversy could spell trouble for the magazine’s credibility, which under past owners had won prestigious journalism prizes, including National Magazine awards.</p> <p>Sports Illustrated, first published in 1954, is known as well for its swimsuit issues, often featuring covers of bikini-clad fashion models, athletes and other celebrities. But, as Futurism noted, it also once published contributions from famed writers such as William Faulkner and John Updike.</p> <p>Sports Illustrated is not the only publication dabbling with AI. In January 2023, BuzzFeed’s CEO, Jonah Peretti, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/buzzfeed-stock-openai-meta-creator-content-deals-1235310858/\">announced</a> the website would integrate AI into its content and make it a part of its core business.</p> <p>BuzzFeed has since published AI-written quizzes and <a href=\"https://futurism.com/buzzfeed-publishing-articles-by-ai\">travel guides</a> – a practice with which the company is still experimenting.</p> <p>Such moves by Sports Illustrated and BuzzFeed stoke fears of a rise in dystopian content farms and more trouble in the already embattled, shrinking news media sector. The use of AI is cost-efficient compared to human writers and content creators, arguably offering a potential and tempting solution to the financial troubles in the industry.</p> <p>Sports Illustrated has been in financial troubles for a few years now.

I’m sorry. I have never lied about anything or been unethical during my time as a sports broadcaster.</p> <p>“In the absence of a coach providing any information that could further my report I would use that information that I learned and saw during the first half to create my report … I have nothing but respect for sideline reporters and for the tireless work they put in behind the scenes and on the field. I am only appreciative and humbled to work alongside some of the best in the business and call them some of my best friends.”</p> <p>Thompson’s colleagues in the industry were quick to condemn her podcast remarks.</p> <p>Kevin Smith, a board member of the Society of Professional Journalists, the US’s oldest organization representing journalists, told the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/16/charissa-thompson-fabricate-sideline-reports/\">Washington Post</a>: “This is just appallingly bad journalism to engage in, and to brag about it and defend it as harmless is beyond the pale. The SPJ’s ethics code addresses truth, harm, independence and accountability. She gets the trifecta for destroying three ethical tenets with her lying.”</p> <p>Rachel Baribeau, a host for College Sports on SiriusXM, called Thompson’s revelation “a sad day for females in the industry”.</p> <p>“So while many of you think it’s no big deal because you don’t see the value of sideline reporters anyhow, please know MOST ALL OF US, including the brown and black ones, [of] which I am one, worked our butts off to get to where we are, and this sets us ALL back!</p> <p>“Not to mention the fact that I take relationships SO seriously; if I made up something on the sidelines, and a coach got wind of it, and he knew we did not have that conversation or that I flat-out lied, I was done in the industry.”</p> <p>The ESPN reporter Molly McGrath issued a warning to new journalists. She said: “Young reporters: this is not normal or ethical. Coaches and players trust us with sensitive information, and if they know that you’re dishonest and don’t take your role seriously, you’ve lost all trust and credibility.”</p> <p>Thompson’s is not the first case of a sports reporter admitting to lying in their reporting.</p> <p>In an episode of another <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-47-care-or-dont-care-with-jay-cutler/id1548527210?i=1000547758668\">podcast</a> called Calm Down, the former ESPN star Erin Andrews, in conversation with Thompson, said she also made up quotes.</p> <p>In 2022, Andrews said: “I’ve done that, too, for a coach that I didn’t want to throw under the bus because he was telling me all the wrong stuff!”</p> <p>Ronald Reagan, long before he became US president, was a radio sports reporter in Des Moines, Iowa: he lied about being present at games.</p> <p>According to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library &amp; Museum, Reagan “would call Chicago Cubs games, but rather than being at the game, he would recreate the action from nothing but a slip of paper typed by a telegraph operator who was transcribing plays sent by Morse code.</p> <p>“On June 7, 1934, with the Cubs and the Cardinals tied 0-0 in the ninth inning, with Billy Jurges at-bat and Dizzy Dean out on the mound, the line went dead. Rather than lose his audience, Reagan improvised a streak of foul balls that lasted nearly 12 minutes until the wire came back.”</p>','2023-11-17 11:53:37',1,'2023-12-26 01:44:59','2023-12-26 01:44:59'),(618,'Sports quiz of the week: Amanda Serrano, Lions and Ronnie O’Sullivan','sports-quiz-of-the-week-amanda-serrano-lions-and-ronnie-osullivan',432,6,77,'','https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/dec/08/sports-quiz-week-lions-osullivan-serrano-football-rugby-snooker-boxing-darts-golf','https://media.guim.co.uk/a8d61777e5f37baed6fc3511cd6ede42182b33f4/0_0_5000_3000/500.jpg','<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"08f89e7d-2092-4b89-8eae-2c3c23451d97\" data-atom-type=\"quiz\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"quiz\" data-questions-length=\"15\" data-title=\"Sports quiz of the week: Lions, Ronnie O’Sullivan and Amanda Serrano\">\n    <ol class=\"quiz__questions\">\n     <li class=\"quiz__question question\" data-text=\"The British and Irish Lions have been competing since 1888.

While personality is not a qualifying factor for Spoty, Earps has it in spades: she was standout performer to help England to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2023/aug/20/womens-world-cup-final-spain-crowned-after-beating-england-in-pictures#:~:text=Women\'s%20World%20Cup%20final%3A%20Spain,in%20pictures%20%7C%20Football%20%7C%20The%20Guardian\">the World Cup final</a>, where she produced one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/12/football-daily-mary-earps-benefits-of-having-a-personality#:~:text=Her%20penalty%20save%20from%20Spain\'s,any%20sporting%20moment%20of%202023.\">most iconic sporting moments of the year</a>, brilliantly saving a penalty from Spain’s Jenni Hermoso before promptly yelling ‘fucking yes, fuck off!’ as the cameras zoomed in on her euphoric face. There was uproar when the 30-year-old’s England goalkeeping shirt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/23/mary-earps-england-nike-replica-shirt-womens-world-cup\">was not made available by Nike</a> before and during the World Cup. More than 170,000 people signed a petition in protest, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/17/mary-earps-nike-world-cup-kit-injustice-england\">Nike later reversed its decision</a>, with the £100 jersey selling out in hours.</p> <h2>Rory McIlroy</h2> <p>McIlroy’s return to form has been a welcome one, even if his major drought is now going to be extended to a 10th year. The Northern Irishman fell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/19/wyndham-clark-holds-nerve-to-win-2023-us-open-as-rory-mcilroy-falls-just-short\">agonisingly short at the US Open</a>, one shot behind winner Wyndham Clark, but has had plenty of on-course success. McIlroy hit arguably the shot of the year – a 2-iron into wind to 10 feet – to make birdie and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/16/rory-mcilroy-denies-macintyre-with-birdie-birdie-finish-to-win-scottish-open-golf\">win the Scottish Open on the 72nd hole</a>, while his flawless performance in the Ryder Cup led Europe to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/01/rory-mcilroy-fights-back-tears-after-europe-beat-usa-to-win-ryder-cup-report\">a tearful victory over the USA</a>. McIlroy’s return to the No 1 ranking in February has added weight to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/13/rory-mcilroy-would-retire-rather-than-play-liv-golf\">his off-course comments against LIV</a> and the civil war that has engulfed golf in 2023, where he has become a leader, talisman and elder statesman of the game at 34.</p> <h2>Katarina Johnson-Thompson</h2> <p>Is Katarina Johnson-Thompson the best all-round athlete in the world? The Liverpool-born heptathlete won <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/20/katarina-johnson-thompson-stages-great-world-championship-comeback\">her second world title in August</a>, a most unlikely comeback after injury – a torn achilles and torn calf – blighted the last few years of her career. But the British public love an underdog story and Johnson-Thompson delivered lifetime bests in the shot put and javelin to claim victory. The 30-year-old is now targeting her first Olympic gold next year in Paris but knows from experience the pitfalls of elite sport, symbolised by her tattoo of a blue shell from the Mario Kart game over her achilles scar. “When life is going too well, a blue shell can always be hovering around the corner to take you out,” she explained.</p> <h2>Frankie Dettori</h2> <p>Speaking of comebacks, here comes Frankie, British horse racing’s adopted son turned father figure. The Italian jockey is one of only two non-Brits to have scaled the Spoty podium (with New Zealand speedway star Barry Briggs, who was second twice in the 1960s). In the past Dettori has never got closer than his third-place finish in 1996. In 2023, Dettori has had a wild year to match his persona: a farewell tour, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/12/frankie-dettori-puts-retirement-on-hold-to-continue-horse-racing-career-in-usa\">retirement U-turn</a>, and a victorious and dramatic final hurrah at Champions Day at Ascot (where his newly-built statue now stands), prevailing in the Champion Stakes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/21/frankie-dettori-ascot-champions-day-horse-racing-report\">in his final ride on British soil</a>, adding to his wins in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/22/frankie-dettori-wins-the-gold-cup-at-his-last-royal-ascot-on-courage-mon-ami-horse-racing\">Gold Cup at Royal Ascot</a>, the Coronation Cup triumph at Epsom and two Classics victories.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"198215c1a33b141276fa73801d0eb0dfae541f05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/198215c1a33b141276fa73801d0eb0dfae541f05/0_0_4500_2995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frankie Dettori does his trademark flying dismount from horse King of Steel after winning the Champion Stakes at Ascot in October. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fitting end to his racing career in the UK as Frankie Dettori does his trademark flying dismount from King of Steel after winning the Champion Stakes at Ascot in October.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maureen McLean/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Alfie Hewett</h2> <p>In terms of titles won, Hewett is the runaway leader here. The wheelchair tennis player is a phenomenon, winning seven singles tournaments, including two majors, and only narrowly missing out on a third grand slam title at Wimbledon. Ranked No 1 in singles, he and Gordon Reid also claimed three of the four doubles majors on offer in Australia, France and SW19, while Hewett played a pivotal part in Great Britain’s World Team Cup glory. Already an OBE at the age of 26, Hewett could become the first para-athlete to win Spoty – Tanni Grey-Thompson and Jonnie Peacock finished third in 2000 and 2017 respectively.</p> <h2>Stuart Broad</h2> <p>Sporting legacies are not just constructed by scores, numbers and titles but moments and memories, especially in cricket: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/jun/24/20-great-ashes-moments-andrew-flintoff\">Andrew Flintoff consoling Brett Lee</a> at Edgbaston, Shane Warne’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/apr/29/20-great-ashes-moments-shane-warne\">Ball of the Century</a>, Monty Panesar and Jimmy Anderson’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/may/02/20-great-ashes-moments-cardiff\">last-wicket stand</a>. Broad cemented his own legacy with a stunning farewell in the final Ashes Test after the shock announcement of his retirement. Having scored a six with his last ball as a batter, he took the final wicket of the match to give England victory, ending with 604 career Test wickets. Broad did not have a perfect year, but few can doubt his legend in an England shirt and there were no finer finishes than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/31/englands-stuart-broad-reflects-on-pure-joy-after-sealing-fifth-test-victory\">at the sun-drenched Oval</a> in July.</p> <h2>A spot of bother …</h2> <p>Spoty has always been contentious. Roger Bannister was snubbed in the first-ever award in 1954 for his pacemaker, Chris Chataway. This year, similarly, there were some omissions from the main shortlist that caused a stir. Josh Kerr, Britain’s remarkable 1500m world champion, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/dec/14/josh-kerr-massively-disappointed-by-bbc-sports-personality-of-the-year-snub\">told the Guardian last week</a> he was “massively disappointed” not to be nominated. The World Athletics president, Seb Coe, was slightly more forthright: “Are you having a laugh, Spoty?” he tweeted. Real Madrid’s Jude Bellingham has a claim after becoming arguably the best male footballer in the world, while Ronnie O’Sullivan celebrated his eighth UK snooker championship three days before his 48th birthday, making him both the youngest and oldest winner of the event.</p> <p><em>Follow it live with Barry Glendenning at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk\">theguardian.com</a> or watch on BBC One from 7pm GMT on Tuesday, iPlayer or the BBC Sport website.

She was the first person to bring back that gold. And that inspired all of us to do our jobs.”</p> <p>Meanwhile Kerr, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/aug/23/britain-josh-kerr-stuns-jakob-ingebrigtsen-to-win-world-athletics-championship-1500m-gold\" title=\"\">dramatic 1500m victory</a> over the Norwegian superstar Jakob Ingebrigtsen was one of the highlights of the sporting year, admitted that his Spoty snub would only fuel him to succeed at the Paris Olympics.</p> <p>“I’m in a very cut-and-dried sport,” he said. “You’re fast enough, you run a qualifying time, you get into the event. Not a lot of things throughout my whole career have been dependent on the judgment of others. I’ve always been taught to leave with no doubt out there but obviously I left a bit of doubt, so that’s the reality.</p> <p>“But I’m not sitting there crying about it. I’m getting out the door and getting my work in for next year. I’m here to get medals – that’s my job. That’s why I get selected. When it’s deemed good enough for Sports Personality of the Year, hopefully I’ll be there representing athletics.”</p> <p>When told by one journalist that he should have been on the shortlist, Kerr replied: “I appreciate that – I’d love to see the minutes of the meeting if it’s ever going to come out.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4035dca90d0b5c41eee96d89daf5419a6913c1b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4035dca90d0b5c41eee96d89daf5419a6913c1b6/0_0_3500_2440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Great Britain’s Josh Kerr stuns Jakob Ingebrigtsen to win 1500m gold in Budapest\" width=\"1000\" height=\"697\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Great Britain’s Josh Kerr stuns Jakob Ingebrigtsen to win 1500m gold in Budapest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kerr also revealed that he might have to sacrifice competing at the World Indoor Championships in Glasgow in March to be fully ready for the Olympic final on 6 August – and that he was currently having “very difficult” conversations with his American coach, Danny Mackey.</p> <p>“It’s in Glasgow. I grew up racing there. So I’m banging the drum for it,” said Kerr. “But he’s like: ‘Well, you know, you told me that everything has to be towards this 6 August goal. So why are we getting emotional when, even if you win World Indoor gold, if you don’t make the Olympics, then the year is a failure.’</p> <p>“It’s difficult to have an American coach sometimes, but it helps in other ways. Whereas if I had a British coach, I think it would be a situation of, like: ‘Let’s get patriotic. Let’s get down to Glasgow and do a job.’ Which is what I want to do. We’re in those discussions now. But it’s been a very difficult conversation and we haven’t come to any conclusions yet.</p> <p>“Also, I’ve had this Olympics circled for a very, very long time – 12 years, to be exact. I realised that at that point I’d be at the peak of my career and in the 1500m it made sense that this would be the one. I look back sometimes and think: ‘If I could dream up coming into the year as a current world champion, already having won an Olympic bronze, I wouldn’t be in a much better situation than I am now.’ So I’m going in with confidence.”</p> <p>Kerr also paid tribute to Mackey, who became a single dad last year when his wife passed away. “Danny is going through a lot in life,” he said. “He’s a single dad and he’s also got 14 or 15 other athletes that he treats like his family. But I don’t believe that he’s skipped a beat when it comes to coaching. And I owe my career to that, because I don’t know anyone else who could go through the stuff that he’s gone through, and continues to go through, and is able to be at the level he is coaching.”</p>','2023-12-14 13:00:05',1,'2023-12-26 01:45:03','2023-12-26 01:45:03'),(622,'Mary Earps wins BBC Sports Personality of the Year award for 2023','mary-earps-wins-bbc-sports-personality-of-the-year-award-for-2023',434,6,78,'Mary Earps, the England goalkeeper, has been named the BBC’s Sports Personality of the Year for 2023 after 12 months of success both on and off the field.

We all go through hard times. And in whatever walk of life we’re in, I think football is a vehicle, and we can all change the world in some small way. So that’s kind of what I’m trying to do.”</p> \n<p>Earps was the breakout star of a Lionesses side which battled their way to the World Cup final last summer.

An explosion of satisfaction was accompanied by a stream of expletives. But while the images drew some tut-tutting, for others her exclamation captured the passion of sporting endeavour as well as any moment this year. Earps went on to further cement her connection with the British public by pursuing Nike over its decision not to put a replica of her goalkeeping kit on sale for fans. Eventually Nike reversed its decision and two editions of the shirt have since sold out.</p> \n<p>Broad came second in the public vote – which is conducted live during the TV broadcast – after he retired from cricket in the most sensational way possible, with a pair of wickets to win the final Test of an Ashes series. He finished his international career with 604 Test wickets for England. Johnson-Thompson, meanwhile, won gold at the World Athletics Championships in Budapest this summer, two years after being forced to abandon the Tokyo Olympics with injury.</p> \n<p>Confronting adversity was one of the consistent themes of this year’s Spoty. This was the 70th edition of the BBC’s annual gala, with the world of sport – and broadcasting – having changed in no small way since Christopher Chataway beat Roger Bannister to the title in the year the latter broke the four-minute mile (with Chataway his pace maker). The BBC drafted in David Beckham to lead the anniversary tributes and remind viewers of its importance to the honoured athletes, while Paula Radcliffe recalled her triumph in 2002, driven by fans who had to fill in and cut out a coupon in the Radio Times to vote.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere in the awards there was another treble for the Manchester City men’s team.

Along the way Brookes, from Cheshire, became the first woman to complete a 1440 degree rotation jump, became the first Briton to win a title in the slopestyle discipline and secured the Big Air title at the Snowboard World Cup. A clearly delighted Brookes told the audience that being at the ceremony was one of her “biggest dreams” and that her focus is now on Winter Olympic gold in Milan in 2026.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eab35d41-dbe9-4aec-9209-ae22c3b80688\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Download the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for \'The Guardian\'.</li>\n     <li>If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.</li>\n     <li>In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.</li>\n     <li>Turn on sport notifications.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Fatima Whitbread won the Helen Rollason award, recalling her friendship with the much-loved broadcaster as she spoke in support of children in the care sector.</p> \n<p>The lifetime achievement award was given to Sir Kenny Dalglish who said he would “treasure this award dearly”, while the unsung hero was Desmond Smith, chair of the Sheffield Caribbean Sports Club, founded in 1986 as a response to the racism experienced by black Britons in other local clubs.</p>','2023-12-19 16:04:32',1,'2023-12-26 01:45:04','2023-12-26 01:45:04'),(623,'Major gambling firms caught enabling illegal in-play sports bets in Australia','major-gambling-firms-caught-enabling-illegal-in-play-sports-bets-in-australia',435,6,77,'Some of Australia’s biggest gambling companies have been caught facilitating illegal in-play bets on sporting matches, leading to calls for money to be returned to punters.

The checks and balances are not. The Guardian has revealed that the government is legislating, without fanfare, to allow the police and the National Crime Agency to run facial recognition searches <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/dec/20/police-to-be-able-to-run-face-recognition-searches-on-50m-driving-licence-holders\">across the UK’s driving licence records</a>. When the police have an image, they will be able to identify the person, it is hoped, through the photographic images the state holds for the purposes of ensuring that the roads are safe.</p> <p>Searching those digital images would have taken more man-hours than could have been justified in the old analogue world. It is now a matter of pushing a button, thanks to the wonders of artificial intelligence systems that are able to match biometric measurements in a flash.</p> <p>There are those who say that none of this is anything to worry about for those who have done nothing wrong. This summer, the government abolished the office of the biometrics and surveillance camera commissioner, an independent watchdog. The last holder of that role, Fraser Sampson, told the Guardian that this was the argument that frustrated him more than any other. The computer will say you are there, at the perimeter of a crime or perhaps at the heart of it, and at times there will be scant opportunity or even motive to argue back. Think of the speeding cameras and the notices that few contest.</p> <p>In relation to the use of the driving records, did those passing their tests understand or agree in any meaningful way to the images they provided for their licences to be added to what is in effect a permanent police lineup for whenever the law is seeking suspects or witnesses to a crime? If not, what are the consequences for the age-old concept of British policing by consent?</p> <p>Then we come to the frailty of these systems. An estimated global TV audience of about 300 million watched the coronation of King Charles III. The use of live facial recognition cameras by the police made the event in London the largest public deployment of AI-driven policing in British history. Yet, just a few weeks later, a House of Commons committee heard that the system used could show racial bias at certain thresholds.</p> <p>Speaking to the science, innovation and technology committee, Dr Tony Mansfield, a principal research scientist at the National Physical Laboratory, said the system used by the Metropolitan police, the UK’s largest force, was prone to bias against black individuals on a set of test data created for his investigations. It is believed that the Met deployed higher thresholds than they needed when seeking matches between their watchlists and their live camera feeds. But at a certain threshold there was an arguably unacceptable high risk of false positive identifications.</p> <p>Who was regulating this?

It’s super exciting.”</p> <p>Cloud technology enables businesses to access computing power via the internet. Before it came along in the 2000s, companies would have owned and run private physical servers on their premises. They would have been responsible for their upkeep and for fixing them when things went wrong; they would also have been limited to the power and capacity that server could provide, and security was often compromised. Moving to the cloud ensures access to a set of security tools that can better detect, assess and warn customers about threats to their data. When cloud technology took over, with companies such as Microsoft offering access to large public servers via the web, the flexibility and ability to scale up or down was transformative.</p> <p><strong>Pay-as-you-go<br></strong>“It’s about being able to pay for the resources that you need as and when you need them,” says Colangeli, adding that this characteristic allows businesses to flex and adapt according to their peak trading periods. Not only this, but cloud’s adaptability also stretches to disaster recovery. “You’ve got this pay-as-you-go subscription model, not just for your core applications, but also for managing your disaster recovery. It’s been a great move forward.”</p> <p>Cloud’s flexibility has changed how businesses operate, and it’s also changed how they innovate – something that will become increasingly important for companies coping with the pace of change wrought by Al. “The generative Al era is going to redefine how we operate, and how we innovate with technology for years to come,” says Colangeli. “It’s going to be quick, it’s going to be very fast. It took years for the internet to reach 100 million users. <a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N572608.271051LINKEDIN/B30978720.383173655;dc_trk_aid=574197077;dc_trk_cid=206938656;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=;ltd=;dc_tdv=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">ChatGPT took two months</a>.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N572608.271051LINKEDIN/B30978720.380523293;dc_trk_aid=571558855;dc_trk_cid=204906669;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=;ltd=;dc_tdv=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">According to Gartner</a>, by 2026 global cloud spending will exceed 45% of all enterprise IT spending. The key to keeping up with this pace of change is embedding cloud within an organisation. Microsoft in particular is planning for this uptake by working to make sure its data centres support the increasing demand for both its Azure Al service and Copilot technologies. “Establishing a digital culture is core, and you have to start with the foundations. Cloud technology will be fundamental to this era of Al,” says Colangeli.</p> <p>AI’s impact will differ according to how each company embraces the opportunity, Colangeli says. For example, she has found Microsoft’s recently launched Copilot functionality has transformed her working day. It’s called ‘Copilot’ because it sits alongside you in support. “The speed at which I can now respond to customers is remarkable. Copilot augments me, and helps me accelerate the value I can bring.”</p> <p><strong>Focus on data<br></strong>So what should businesses be doing to ready themselves for the next phase of cloud technology? Colangeli flags that focusing on data should be top priority. “Your success with Al will be as good as the data you hold in your organisation. Making sure your data is accessible on a unified data platform is job number one.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/innovate-with-azure/2023/nov/27/future-proof-your-businesss-cloud-platform-five-things-you-need-to-know\">Future-proof your business’s cloud platform: five things you need to know</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Using AI responsibly will also be a key priority for businesses. Keeping a handle on this can be challenging, however, especially with things moving so rapidly. Colangeli says Microsoft has built a series of principles, tools and processes into its <a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N572608.271051LINKEDIN/B30978720.380502254;dc_trk_aid=571558852;dc_trk_cid=204906666;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=;ltd=;dc_tdv=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Azure</a> platform to help with this. “When you create technologies that can change the world, you must work to ensure that the technology is used responsibly.”</p> <p>Microsoft’s principles are grounded in fairness, reliability, safety, privacy, and security, and the business has built on these to develop practical boundaries. “Having principles is not enough – they are not self-executing, and they could be open to interpretation,” Colangeli says. “For that reason we’ve got a set of tools and practices that we use to set up guardrails around and within all of our products.”</p> <p><strong>Ability to adapt<br></strong>Businesses looking to innovate, evolve, and ensure a place for themselves in the future will want to explore, or ramp up, their use of cloud and Al technologies. The exact approach will differ according to the business, but what’s most important is developing that ability to adapt and flex. “Cloud – particularly what we’ve done with Microsoft Azure – is the most adaptable way to build your business,” says Colangeli. “It’s not one-size-fits-all – every customer has different problems. But cloud computing is the foundation for building a truly digital business.” Building a unified data platform will enable the business to use Al to accelerate value. “But you have to start with the foundations to be able to build on it, and adopt innovation. That’s where it starts.”</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N572608.271051LINKEDIN/B30978720.380498297;dc_trk_aid=571558858;dc_trk_cid=204906672;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=;ltd=;dc_tdv=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read more</a></em></p>','2023-11-27 10:44:22',1,'2023-12-26 01:45:13','2023-12-26 01:45:13'),(628,'North Korea’s spy satellite is a big deal, regardless of how advanced its technology is','north-koreas-spy-satellite-is-a-big-deal-regardless-of-how-advanced-its-technology-is',440,7,77,'North Korea is already believed to be capable of striking the US mainland with a nuclear weapon; now it claims that it can spy on enemy troops, after state media reported the regime’s first successful launch of a surveillance satellite, drawing an immediate response from South Korea.

The GPT-4 AI model that powers the ChatGPT tool, which was developed by the US firm OpenAI, has been able to design and execute chemistry experiments, browse the web and use software tools including other AI models, the experts said.</p> <p>“If we build highly advanced autonomous AI, we risk creating systems that autonomously pursue undesirable goals”, adding that “we may not be able to keep them in check”.</p> <p>Other <a href=\"https://managing-ai-risks.com/\">policy recommendations in the document</a> include: mandatory reporting of incidents where models show alarming behaviour; putting in place measures to stop dangerous models from replicating themselves; and giving regulators the power to pause development of AI models showing dangerous behaviours.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/20/rishi-sunak-global-ai-safety-summit-connor-leahy\">safety summit next week</a> will focus on existential threats posed by AI, such as aiding the development of novel bioweapons and evading human control. The UK government is working with other participants on a statement that is expected to underline the scale of the threat from frontier AI – the term for advanced systems. However, while the summit will outline the risks from AI and measures to combat the threat, it is not expected to formally establish a global regulatory body.</p> <p>Some AI experts argue that fears about the existential threat to humans are overblown. The other co-winner of the 2018 Turing award alongside Bengio and Hinton, Yann LeCun, now chief AI scientist at Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta and who is also attending the summit, told the Financial Times that the notion AI could exterminate humans was “preposterous”.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the authors of the policy document have argued that if advanced autonomous AI systems did emerge now, the world would not know how to make them safe or conduct safety tests on them. “Even if we did, most countries lack the institutions to prevent misuse and uphold safe practices,” they added.</p>','2023-10-24 00:00:21',1,'2023-12-26 01:45:16','2023-12-26 01:45:16'),(631,'Staying in the fast lane: how Confused.com is leveraging AI and cloud technology to improve customer experiences','staying-in-the-fast-lane-how-confusedcom-is-leveraging-ai-and-cloud-technology-to-improve-customer-experiences',443,7,77,'A pioneer in the insurance comparison industry, today, Confused.com serves millions of consumers a year, helping them find the best prices to protect the things they love, power their homes and finance big purchases.

This relies on understanding exactly what customers need and why, to ease anxiety so often associated with financial decisions. Being truly customer-centric is reliant on optimising data, as Nick Sharp, director of data and technology, Confused.com, explains: “Delivering a seamless customer journey, enabling real-time interactions, personalised experiences, and offering a range of tooling beyond the price comparison itself is all about being data-led. It’s about making decisions based on data insights.”</p> <p>Confused.com’s traditional in-house data framework was frustrating this ambition. “When you have an on-premises infrastructure and simple integrations, you are dealing with silos,” says Sharp. “We wanted to bring that together to deliver a more cohesive customer journey. Making financial decisions can be overwhelming – our aim is to reduce that burden as much as possible.”</p> <p>This need prompted the company to seek help from long-term partner Microsoft, which also works with many of Confused.com’s partners, giving it peace of mind that the technology company understood how it wanted to enhance customers’ experience. Confused.com chose to migrate to Microsoft’s cloud computing platform, Azure, a solution that enables it to manage and store its data securely, as well as giving it access to multiple applications, services and tools. “Microsoft’s maturity and range of assets made it appealing,” says Sharp. “The cost element was important too, as well as the huge support offered by Microsoft, which made it a very easy six-month migration.”</p> <p>The migration to Azure, and becoming cloud native, has initiated a culture shift at Confused.com, putting technology at the forefront of the business and allowing it to innovate and challenge the market. “It focused minds on how technology could enable us to go beyond delivering the basic service and actually scale up what we were doing, helping us to derive greater insight and make a bigger difference to customers,” says Sharp. “It has empowered us to position ourselves as thought leaders, and that mindset is driving success.”</p> <p>Considering Confused.com’s panel of partners was key to the decision. The company’s motor panel alone currently has more than 150 providers, and the numerous data feeds between customers and partners need to be robust and fast. “That was a driving factor for choosing Azure, as well as the ability to experiment, and scale,” says Sharp. “It was also about leveraging cloud technology and Azure’s out-of-the-box and customisable solutions.”</p> <p>As Sharp says: “If we get the right message to the right customer at the right time, they are so much more likely to buy.” It was this need to deliver exactly what the customer is looking for at any given moment that also attracted Confused.com to Azure. Its generative AI enables companies to quickly build intelligent apps and scale them, training them to work with its customer data. “That is really where we’re seeing the uplift,” says Sharp.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5c5cfe88433da6bc48fb116fa2c32995387a1fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5c5cfe88433da6bc48fb116fa2c32995387a1fe/0_0_5070_3381/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Confused.com staff\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"5c6917f180021273d92b0a33300d7fb4b96a7687\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c6917f180021273d92b0a33300d7fb4b96a7687/0_0_2466_3699/667.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Sharp\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"18a8c63bdfce8e54505ca0a2dc1164a9fcbdb621\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18a8c63bdfce8e54505ca0a2dc1164a9fcbdb621/0_0_2466_3699/667.jpg\" alt=\" Quote: “Microsoft Azure has empowered us to position ourselves as thought leaders, and that mindset is driving success”\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Migrating to the Azure platform has freed up staff to work on the ‘more gnarly stuff’, rather than repetitive tasks</p></li> </ul> <p>For Confused.com, the technology has supercharged its marketing, improving spend by 10% through data enrichment and personalised offers and recommendations. “That relevance to customers shows we’re getting things right.”</p> <p>Sharp adds that the integration of AI aligns with the company’s commitment to being a customer champion. “By leveraging AI for personalised services and gaining insights into customer needs, we can continue disrupting the insurance industry for the benefit of our customers.”</p> <p>After all, people visit Confused.com seeking advice and reassurance. “For example, can we make any recommendations based on the information a customer has provided? If they are actively telling us they are interested in a product, or if there are any nuances we can respond to, we can be extra helpful,” says Sharp. “It allows us to anticipate what customers need and potentially save them even more time and money by alerting them to the most relevant product at the right time and at competitive prices.” </p> <p>A key part of elevating technology to a more central role was using Azure’s AI capability to automate, freeing employees from repetitive tasks to focus on what Sharp describes as “the more gnarly stuff”. He says: “We can tackle the problems that haven’t been solved for customers – that’s where we can really add value – making that content relevant and personalised, and unearthing insights.”</p> <p>Sharp adds that the impact of Azure goes beyond the company’s technologists. “All of our employees benefit from AI – ultimately it helps them to do their job better, spending more time helping customers to save money, and adding greater value.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26f82d4f9b618d076403687985e6ddd47611b4ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26f82d4f9b618d076403687985e6ddd47611b4ef/0_0_5105_3404/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Sharp using Microsoft Azure \" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>‘It’s a gamechanger knowing we don’t have to build everything ourselves,’ says Sharp</p></li> </ul> <p>While use of Azure’s AI tools doesn’t remove the need for human input, Sharp says it is hugely valuable for generating ideas and starting conversations, as well as improving efficiencies. “It allows us to worry less about the infrastructure provisioning and scaling because that is all taken care of. Both AI and the cloud keep us operating at speed and meeting customer demand – that is where it matters and where we want our team spending their time.”</p> <p>Since implementing Azure, Confused.com has reduced its analytics lead time by 50%, thanks to improved availability, speed, and richness of data, which is driving informed decisions. This benefits customers directly. “Customers rely on us for timely data products and services, they are not just simply getting a price,” says Sharp. “We are looking at the full customer journey, identifying friction points and experimenting and addressing them quickly, and we are able to swiftly respond to customer feedback.”</p> <p>The company’s ceaseless drive to add value to customers has also been realised by Azure, allowing the company to introduce cashback and rewards, which are customised incentives rooted in data. “We are now able to give much more back to customers and make sure the experience is optimum,” says Sharp. “That additional capability has been enabled by our migration to Azure.”</p> <p>Confused.com has big plans to continue building on its partnership with Microsoft and its success with Azure, and Sharp says it will carry on leveraging Microsoft’s latest off-the-shelf components and solutions to solve problems. “It’s a gamechanger knowing we don’t have to build everything ourselves or find our own solutions. We can tap into the expertise of a partner that truly understands our industry.”</p> <p>He adds that the “ultimate dream” is simplification of the customer journey: “The more we can remove the friction points, the closer we can get to automatic switching. It’s great from a technology stance but it’s also great from a customer stance too. With so many people feeling the pinch at the moment, where people spend their money is important. So for us, saving people time, money and allowing them to make confident decisions, at no cost to them, is now more important than ever.” </p> <p>Azure’s cloud and AI capabilities are playing a key role in ensuring that Confused.com remains dominant in a fierce market. “It is amazing being fully cloud native, and AI promises to be a very exciting next chapter,” says Sharp.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-latest-trends-in-cloud-migration-and-modernization.html?lcid=EN-GB\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read more</a></em></p>','2023-12-20 06:28:58',1,'2023-12-26 01:45:17','2023-12-26 01:45:17'),(632,'Psycho-Pass: Providence review – anime thriller investigates dark side of technology','psycho-pass-providence-review-anime-thriller-investigates-dark-side-of-technology',444,7,77,'With the iconic 1995 Ghost in the Shell in their locker, Japan’s Production IG studio has been a long way ahead of the curve on the now-inescapable AI and cybernetics front.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said the chances of policymakers getting it wrong were “pretty high” and posed a threat to its central “soft landing” forecast for the global economy. The Paris-based OECD – which has 38 rich country members – said its best estimate is that the UK would suffer a second year of sluggish growth in 2024, and foresaw little prospect of a pre-election surge in activity. In its half-yearly economic outlook, the OECD said UK growth would remain “stable but low”, with national output rising by 0.5% in 2023 and by 0.7% in 2024.

Six months ago, it was predicting expansion of 0.3% this year and 1% next.</p> <p>Despite speculation that the recent fall in inflation would bring forward cuts in interest rates from the Bank of England to next spring, the OECD said it expected official borrowing costs to remain unchanged at 5.25% for the whole of 2024.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the phasing out of energy subsidies and the impact of freezing tax allowances and thresholds would mean the Treasury sucking 2% of gross domestic product – about £50bn – out of the economy.</p> <p>Clare Lombardelli, the thinktank’s chief economist, said a soft landing for advanced economies was far from guaranteed, adding: “The risks around it are pretty high.”</p> <p>Lombardelli said the OECD had not calibrated the chances of a hard landing but added: “The risks of getting policy wrong are higher than they have been. It is unclear how much of the past tightening has fed through and how much is yet to come.”</p> <p>Its report said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/19/germany-world-economic-slowdown-oecd-interest-rates-china\">Germany</a> would be the worst-performing developed country this year, with Europe’s biggest economy contracting by 0.1% before recovering to post 0.6% growth in 2024. Overall, the 20-nation eurozone is expected to expand by 0.6% this year, against 2.4% in the US.</p> <p>The OECD nations as a whole are forecast to grow by 1.7% in 2023 and by 1.4% in 2024. The world economy – boosted by growth in the non-members India and China – is predicted to expand by 2.9% in 2023 and 3% in 2024.</p> <p>Lombardelli said: “In the United States, the economy is demonstrating more strength than expected, and there is a risk that inflation proves to be persistent. In the euro area, the full impact of tighter monetary policy is still to appear and activity may be hit more strongly than we expect.”</p> <p>The OECD expressed concern that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel-hamas-war\">Israel-Hamas war</a> could spill over into a wider regional conflict. “Heightened geopolitical tensions due to the conflict following the terrorist attacks on Israel by Hamas are a key near-term concern, particularly if the conflict were to broaden,” the economic outlook said.</p> <p>“This could result in significant disruptions to energy markets and major trade routes, and additional risk repricing in financial markets, that would slow growth and add to inflation.”</p> <p>Lombardelli said: “Inflation is easing but growth is slowing. The tightening of monetary policy needed to tackle inflation is taking effect. Despite stronger-than-expected GDP growth in 2023, tightening financial conditions weak trade and subdued confidence are taking a toll. Housing markets and bank-dependent economies, particularly in Europe, are feeling the impact.</p> <p>“In summary, the global economy is grappling with inflation, slowing growth, and mounting fiscal pressures. Policymakers must prioritise macroeconomic stability, structural reforms, smart fiscal policies and international cooperation to foster sustainable and inclusive growth.”</p>','2023-11-29 05:08:43',1,'2023-12-26 01:45:22','2023-12-26 01:45:22'),(635,'The poor rejected spud: why potatoes don’t belong with the other vegetables','the-poor-rejected-spud-why-potatoes-dont-belong-with-the-other-vegetables',19,8,78,'Name: Potatoes.

Magicians can be equally innovative and push the limits. However, many magicians perform familiar tricks or variations of them without feeling the need to innovate.”</p> <p>The magicians were recruited with help from groups including the <a href=\"https://themagiccircle.co.uk/\">Magic Circle in the UK</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.magicsam.com/\">Society of American Magicians</a> and <a href=\"https://www.magician.org/\">the International Brotherhood of Magicians</a>. The participants were aged from late teenagers to 90.</p> <p><a href=\"https://saracrasson.com/\">Sara Crasson</a>, a New York magician who worked on the study, said there were reasons why magicians might be more balanced. “One of the things we often do when we meet is share our origin story – how did we come into this art? It’s very, very common for especially male magicians to come to magic between the ages of eight and 14 to overcome a social deficit in some way. Maybe the bully won’t beat them up if they can show the bully a cool trick.”</p> <p>Magic was a way of getting “positive social status and attention”, she said. “It often helps overcome a lack of social skills. It gives you confidence and can really build you up and help you overcome issues. I think that magic helps.”</p> <p>The study suggests that mental health profiles for magicians are akin to those of mathematicians and scientists. Crasson said precision was an important part of magic. “There’s a lot of precision in how a piece is executed. When you see a top magician performing, in every move, every word, there is meaning and thought.”</p> <p>Crasson works with a cuddly bear called Bamberg in her act but said there was a great deal of human collaboration in magic. “It’s something we’re passionate about. While we are competitors, we are also good friends. There are people I would compete with for a gig but I will also say: ‘Hey, I’m working on this, what do you think?’ And they will give me ideas and I will give them ideas. It’s an amazing community.</p> <p>“My grandfather was a dentist and my father, who was also a magician, was fond of saying the other dentists wouldn’t share their process for bonding teeth. But I have gone to performers and said: ‘I’ve loved what you did. Could you teach me some part of that?’ and they say: ‘Absolutely, here’s how you do it, you have my blessing.’ That kind of embrace is really powerful.” </p>','2023-11-15 00:00:07',1,'2023-12-26 01:45:25','2023-12-26 01:45:25'),(638,'Rwanda bill has Tories outcompeting each other to new levels of insanity','rwanda-bill-has-tories-outcompeting-each-other-to-new-levels-of-insanity',448,8,78,'First as tragedy.

It would be pathetic if they weren’t so dangerous.</p> <p>In the other corner we have the One Nation Tories, the MPs who pride themselves on being the few remaining Conservatives with a vague grasp of reality. Only we can instantly discount them as an irrelevance because at the slightest hint of danger to themselves and their party, they melt away. They never really existed. They had never intended their whispers of doubt to be taken as dissent. Please, please. Just roll over us. We aren’t here.</p> <p>Against this background of performative cruelty, James Cleverly opened the second reading of the Rwanda bill. He is now the best the government can offer, even though he shows no signs of really understanding the legislation he is proposing. Instead he just looks startled and quickly went on the defensive whenever challenged. He wears the badge of Jimmy Dimly with pride.</p> <p>He began by mentioning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/dec/12/asylum-seeker-onboard-bibby-stockholm-barge-dies\">the death of an asylum seeker on the Bibby Stockholm</a>. He did not mention that the death was believed to be suicide. Jimmy D isn’t the best at joining up the dots: his failure to understand that his government’s actions have consequences absolute. The death cast a stain over the entire debate. Though for the most part the home secretary and Rishi Sunak just chattered and laughed together on the frontbench. Good to know they are enjoying themselves.</p> <p>“We are stopping the boats,” Dimly insisted. You’re not. That’s the whole point. That’s why you’re introducing this batshit bill. Jimmy really makes intelligence look like hard work. And the bill was “novel”, he added. As in completely mad.</p> <p>Dimly was going to just reconfigure reality. The truth would be whatever he said it was. George Orwell was demanding royalties. And the UK courts could sod off. They were a waste of space anyway. Far too concerned with determining the law. We are all moral and legal relativists now. Nor would we pay any attention to international law. Apart from Rwandan law. Because the Rwandans had insisted there must be some standards of international law. Such a shame. </p> <p>Tory MP Daniel Kawczynski remarked that Rwanda was accused of sending rape squads into the Democratic Republic of Congo and that President Kagame had been compared to a modern-day Hitler. Jimmy D pumped out his chest in outrage. He had met Kagame and liked him immensely. And Kagame was no Hitler. He didn’t even have a moustache. That told him.</p> <p>At this point, an unfamiliar figure appeared behind the speaker’s chair. The first appearance in the Commons of Peter Bone since he was accused of harassment and bullying. Bone denies the allegations and the Tories had clearly decided that – just for today – his presence in the voting lobbies would be most welcome. As would that of Graham Stuart, the climate change minister. Flown back from Cop28 before a deal had been reached in Dubai. Party before planet. Still, nothing that a bill saying climate change isn’t real won’t solve.</p> <p>Up stepped Robert Jenrick. His conceit and self-importance overflowing. This was his moment. His leadership bid. His few acolytes priapic with excitement. He had taken the responsibilities of high office very seriously. That’s why he had waved through the planning permission of billionaire former pornographer Richard Desmond. </p> <p>Honest Bob tried to look like a grownup. Look at me! Aren’t I a statesman? Speaking without notes! Me, Me, Me. All refugees were potential killers or burglars. He appeared profoundly untroubled by the death of a man on the Bibby Stockholm. All legal routes to challenge the legislation must be blocked. UK or international courts must be trampled underfoot. He couldn’t vote for such a bill.</p> <p>But it soon turned out that others could. Geoffrey Cox had taken a day off from his legal practice to grace the Commons with his presence. He would be sending the Tory chairman a bill for loss of earnings. The Mighty Geoff had examined the bill carefully and declared it fit for purpose. Who would have guessed? And there was Bob Neill. The all-purpose useless wet. The bill nearly crossed a line that he couldn’t vote for. But not quite. A huge relief to a man in search of a principle.</p> <p>Other Tories came and went. Some hinted at abstention but none said they would vote against the government. This was a level of unpleasantness and futility they could live with for now. Just get to Christmas. Let the bill fall apart in the new year. Maybe the new year would never come. Rish! had survived another day. More or less.</p> <p><em>• Depraved New World by John Crace (Guardian Faber, £16.99).

She inhabits each role with empathy and meticulous attention to detail, and her latest, Gracie in Todd Haynes’s seductive, slippery May December, is no exception. In her 30s, Gracie scandalised America by having a sexual relationship with Joe, a 13-year-old boy. She’s served her time in jail, married Joe and raised three children when Natalie Portman as Elizabeth, a Hollywood celebrity, arrives to rake up the past in preparation to play Gracie in a movie. What drew you to the role of Gracie?

In her 30s, Gracie scandalised America by having a sexual relationship with Joe, a 13-year-old boy. She’s served her time in jail, married Joe and raised three children when Natalie Portman as Elizabeth, a Hollywood celebrity, arrives to rake up the past in preparation to play Gracie in a movie.</p> <p><strong>What drew you to the role of Gracie?<br></strong>Generally, when you find two women opposite each other in a script, they’re either in a love affair or it’s a familial relationship – very rarely do you see something where they’re equally matched, in a struggle for narrative dominance. Gracie has the story that she’s telling and she has the reality of having committed this enormous transgression, and in between there’s this unbelievable fragility and emotional volatility and shame.</p> <p><strong>It was shot in just </strong><strong>23 days</strong><strong>, yet you have this intense on-screen dynamic with </strong><strong>Natalie Portman</strong><strong>. Did you already know each other? <br></strong>I knew her a little bit socially from Hollywood events and saw her once at a Stevie Wonder concert, but I think we work very similarly. We both do a great deal of preparation, and we’re serious about our work and maybe not so serious about ourselves.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My job is almost like eating candy.

Did any aspect of her process resonate with you?<br></strong>Even for this, Gracie is a home baker, so I went to visit a woman who’s a home baker, and I visited a florist who showed me how to arrange flowers and gave me specific language. You’re hopefully not like Elizabeth, who is vampiric, but you’re there to learn, otherwise there’s going to be someone in the audience who’s like, ‘That’s not how you do it!’ People see that stuff and it takes them out of the movie.</p> <p><strong>Tell me about your decision to give Gracie a lisp.<br></strong>The narrative Gracie is promoting is that she was a princess who was rescued by her prince, but of course that prince was 13 years old, so to keep the story afloat, she has to elevate that boy to a man, and she remains forever a child. I thought about what I could have, in terms of signifiers, for Gracie to tell her story, and the lisp was something concrete for Natalie to be able to copy, because she was basing her character on mine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a84fe909dcfa4c1fc0cd8666ffc7f67f2e22fbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a84fe909dcfa4c1fc0cd8666ffc7f67f2e22fbe/0_0_2916_1948/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moore in Todd Haynes’s Far from Heaven\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Moore in Todd Haynes’s Far from Heaven, 2002.

Has he ever come to you with a project you’ve said no to?<br></strong>No. I never imagined when I auditioned for <em>Safe</em> 30 years ago that it would be a collaboration that would last this long, but he’s a phenomenal artist and he’s so interested in stories about identity and performance and culture and gender – all of the things that really thrill me. I feel less excited by action in a movie, but if you give me a dramatic relationship between two people, I’m riveted. We have really similar tastes in that sense.</p> <p><strong>You’ve played some really complex, compelling characters. Are you at all haunted by any of them? Do they stick with you?<br></strong>You’re always looking forward in film. My job is to be as prepared as possible, to really know my lines, to know how I feel and do all my research, so that the scene can happen at that moment on camera. There’s something electric about it, but then you’re like, “Next!” It’s almost like eating candy. You don’t think, “Oh, that was great”, you just want more.</p> <p><strong>How do</strong><strong> you find what’s needed to play some of the messier, wilder roles you’ve tackled?<br></strong>You play a facsimile of these people. You do all the work, then you use your imagination to get as close as possible to the story. When you read a great book, you almost feel you’re inhabiting it, and to me that’s what it feels like when I’m acting. The great thing is that film-making is such a collaborative medium; I’m not in that book by myself, we’re all in there. It’s this wonderful experience of play, and of pretend, but also a desire to understand behaviour.</p> <p><strong>Are you a big reader?

Alexis Petridis wrote about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/22/its-just-good-energy-how-tiktok-and-covid-made-drumnbass-hot-again\">genre’s sudden popularity post-pandemic</a> among Zoomers and since then things have only accelerated.

Old handers Chase and Status’s collaboration with Becky Hill, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE3Kvqyef_E\">Disconnect</a>, has been all over dance radio this autumn. And an album that is likely to appear near the top of a lot of year-end lists, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/apr/09/yaeji-with-a-hammer-review-pop-facing-rage-and-candour\">Yaeji’s With a Hammer</a>, features more than its fair share of DnB breakdowns.</p> <p>Yaeji is a good example of how this new wave of DnB and jungle tends to appear in places where you might not expect it: see also the bedroom pop of early revivalist <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tPTrgGptU0\">PinkPantheress</a> or the NYC lo-fi artist <a href=\"https://sippersipper.bandcamp.com/track/nap\">Sipper</a>, or even – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/nov/10/the-guide-shoegaze-bands\">as we covered in a recent Guide</a> – the shoegaze of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/nov/10/the-guide-shoegaze-bands#:~:text=The%20Guide-,The%20Guide%20%23112%3A%20The%20bands%20saving%20shoegaze%2C%20from,Deafheaven%20to%20Feeble%20Little%20Horse&amp;text=Cartwheel%2C%20the%20excellent%20new,Slowdive%20or%20My%20Bloody%20Valentine.\">Hotline TNT</a>. For these artists drum’n’bass serves as a surprising texture to add to songs, its syncopated breakbeats and sub-bass blasts sounding relatively novel after a decade of minimalist trap beats and the corporate sheen of EDM and house.

There’s a dismaying irrationality in the answers. Stephen Hawking claimed that “spreading out [into space] may be the only thing that saves us from ourselves” – from the threat of human-made catastrophes such as the climate crisis or nuclear war. Well, lord knows the world has problems, but supposing they can be solved anywhere other than Earth is an escapist fantasy; Nasa’s claim that “the urgency to establish humanity as a multiplanet species has been re-validated by the emergence of a worldwide pandemic” borders on misinformation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/24/the-big-idea-why-the-laws-of-physics-will-never-explain-the-universe\">The big idea: Why the laws of physics will never explain the universe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The timescales just don’t add up. Climate change either will or won’t become an existential risk well before it’s realistic to imagine a self-sustaining Martian settlement of millions: we’re talking a century or more. Speculating about nuclear war post-2123 is science fiction. So the old environmentalist cliche is right: there is no Planet B, and to suggest otherwise risks lessening the urgency of preserving Planet A. As for the threat of a civilisation-ending meteorite impact: one that big is expected only every several million years, so it’s safe to say there are more urgent worries. The sun going out? Sure, in 5bn years, and if you think there will still be humans then, you don’t understand evolution.</p> <p>For some, the justification for planetary settlement is not existential fear but our innate drive to explore. “The settlement of North America and other continents was a prelude to humanity’s greater challenge: the space frontier,” reads a 1986 document by the Reagan-appointed US National Commission of Space, rather clumsily letting slip who it was and was not speaking for. But at least “Because it would be cool” is an honest answer to the question: “Why go?”</p> <p>So let’s go with that, and assume something like Musk’s big fat rocket can get us there. What might life in Mars City be like? Advocates for off-world colonies love to show images like those in the physicist and space activist Gerard O’Neill’s 1977 book The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space – an orderly, utopian American suburbia of chic apartments and parks, simply transplanted elsewhere in the solar system. Science fiction, on the other hand, is full of grim outposts on bleak, frozen planets, and savage prison or mining colonies. If history is any guide, frontier settlements are no picnic, and certainly not the kind of places that nurture harmonious, tolerant societies. If you want to know what to expect from colonies established by “billionauts” such as Musk or Jeff Bezos, perhaps ask their employees in Amazon warehouses or the Twitter offices. Many advocates for space settlement are “neoliberal techno-utopians”, says the astrophysicist Erika Nesvold, who sell it on a libertarian ticket as an escape from the pesky regulation of governments.</p> <p>The space industry doesn’t talk much about such things. As Nesvold discovered when she began quizzing commercial space companies in 2016, ethical questions such as human rights or environmental protection in space typically meet with a response of “we’ll worry about that later”. The idea is to get there first.</p> <p>If the notion of a “colonial transporter” gave you a twinge of unease, you’re not alone. Associations of space exploration with colonialism have existed ever since it was first mooted in the 17th century. Some advocates ridicule the comparison: there are surely no indigenous people to witness the arrival of the first crewed spaceships on Mars. But the analogy gets stronger when thinking about how commercial incentives might distort rights afforded to the settlers (Musk has floated the idea of loans to get to Mars City being paid off by work on arrival), or how colonial powers waged proxy wars in far-off lands. And if the argument is that these settlements would exist to save us from catastrophe on Earth, the question of who gets to go becomes more acute. So far it has been the rich and famous.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Space is harsh beyond any earthly comparison, and it will be constantly trying to kill you</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Perhaps the most pernicious aspect of the “Columbus” comparison, however, is that it encourages us to believe that space is just another ocean to sail, with the lure of virgin lands to draw us. But other worlds are not the New World; space is harsh beyond any earthly comparison, and it will be constantly trying to kill you. Quite aside from the cold and airlessness, the biggest danger is the radiation: streams of charged, high-energy particles, from which we are shielded by the Earth’s magnetic field. Currently, a crewed mission to Mars would be prohibited by the permitted radiation limits for astronauts. We don’t have any solutions to that problem.</p> <p>Planetary scientists are often among the least enthusiastic about space settlements. It’s not surprising really – you may as well ask ecologists if we should build cities in the Amazon. But whether you think we should preserve Mars for scientific study or try to “terraform” it to give it a breathable atmosphere and a warmer climate, it would be best to have that debate before we arrive.</p> <h2>Further reading</h2> <p><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/off-earth-9780262047548?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Off-Earth: Ethical Questions and Quandaries for Living in Outer Space</a> by Erika Nesvold (MIT, £26)</p> <p><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/astrotopia-9780226821122?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Astrotopia: The Dangerous Religion of the Corporate Space Race</a> by Mary-Jane Rubenstein (Chicago, £18.33)</p> <p><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/turning-dust-to-gold-9781441908704?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Turning Dust to Gold: Building a Future on the Moon and Mars</a> by Haym Benaroya (Springer Praxis, £44.99)</p>','2023-08-21 06:30:15',1,'2023-12-26 01:45:29','2023-12-26 01:45:29'),(642,'Sudan conflict: warring sides blame each other for strike on key bridge','sudan-conflict-warring-sides-blame-each-other-for-strike-on-key-bridge',452,8,77,'The Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have blamed each other for a strike that damaged a bridge over the Jebel Aulia dam south of Khartoum, the latest piece of key infrastructure to suffer in a seven-month war.
